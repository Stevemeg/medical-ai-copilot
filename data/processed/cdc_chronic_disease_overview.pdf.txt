For 2013 prevalence estimates, the threshold was 1) 5 percentage points in the range of 25% to 75%, 2) 4 percentage points in the ranges of 10% to <25% or >75% to 90%, and 3) 3 percentage points in the ranges of 1% to <10% or >90% to 99%. We used multiple imputation and the fully conditional specification method with 5 generated multiple data sets to account for missing values (1.4%) across years and measures.

In the youngest group, 27% reported 1 or more conditions and 7% reported MCC. In the midlife group, 63% reported 1 or more conditions and 33% reported MCC, and in the oldest age group, 88% reported 1 or more conditions and 64% reported MCC. Data from 1999–2000 to 2017–2020 also showed a stable trend among US adults without hypertension; however, MCC increased among adults with hyper- tension (21). When limited to years (2013–2014 through 2017–2020) that overlapped with our study, trends among both groups (adults with and without hypertension) remained stable (21). Although differences exist in the magnitude of the preval- ence of MCCs between our study and other studies, they can be at least partially explained by differences in the chronic conditions included between studies. For example, hepatitis was a condition Figure 2.
