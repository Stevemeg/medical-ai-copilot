In India, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Africa, four countries that account for 44% of 1.3 global TB cases, there were large drops in the reported 1.2 number of people diagnosed with TB between January 1.1 and June 2020 (Fig. E.3).

Negative impacts on essential TB services include the reallocation of human, financial and other resources from TB to the COVID-19 response. Many countries have reported the use of GeneXpert machines for COVID-19 testing instead of diagnostic testing for TB (43 countries including 13 high TB burden countries), reassignment of staff in national TB programmes to COVID-19 related duties (85 countries including 20 high TB burden coun- tries), and reallocation of budgets (52 countries including 14 high TB burden countries).

The UN Secretary-General’s 2020 progress report on TB urges countries to implement 10 priority recommendations needed to reach targets and reduce the enormous human and societal toll caused by TB (Fig. E.5). The overarching message of this report and that of the UN Secretary-General’s 2020 progress report on TB is the same. High-level commitments have galvanized global, regional and national progress towards ending TB, but urgent and more ambitious investments and actions are required to put the world on track to reach targets, espe- cially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 For these people, the lifetime risk of developing TB disease is about 5–10%. 2 WHO’s annual rounds of global TB data collection and the annu- al WHO Global TB Report are key elements of “monitoring and reporting” in the WHO multisectoral accountability framework for TB. 3 The UN Secretary General’s report was released in September 2020. 4 The treatment targets were built on the WHO Flagship Initiative “Find.

All. #EndTB” and the funding targets were based on the Stop TB Partnership’s Global Plan to End TB, 2018–2022. 5 Here and elsewhere, “range” in the context of estimates of TB disease burden refers to the 95% uncertainty interval. 6 When an HIV-positive person dies from TB disease, the under- lying cause is coded as HIV in the International Classification of Diseases system. 7 The other 22 countries are Angola, Brazil, Cambodia, Central African Republic, the Congo, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ken- ya, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Thailand, the United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 8 The 95% uncertainty interval is 400 000–535 000. 9 MDR-TB is defined as resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. 10 Reductions in other WHO regions were 3.5% in the Eastern Med- iterranean Region, 8.7% in the South-East Asia Region and 6.1% in the Western Pacific Region. In the WHO Region of the Amer- icas, incidence is slowly increasing, owing to an upward trend in Brazil. 11 Including TB deaths among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive people. 12 Reductions in other WHO regions were 6.1% in the Americas, 11% in the Eastern Mediterranean, 10% in South-East Asia and 17% in the Western Pacific. 13 Calculated as the sum of direct medical expenditures, non-med- ical expenditures and income losses. 14 Funding for TB research is monitored by Treatment Action Group; the latest data are from their 2019 report. 15 Other countries with large relative increases in 2017–2019 are shown in Fig. 5.2. 16 The numbers cited refer to pulmonary cases. 17 The other 8 countries were the Democratic Republic of the Con- go, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation and Viet Nam. 18 The drug regimens currently recommended by WHO are explained in Chapter 6. xx GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020

FIG. E.5 10 priority recommendations of the UN Secretary-General’s 2020 progress report on TB for actions needed to accelerate progress towards global TB targets 1. Fully activate high-level leadership to urgently reduce TB deaths and drive multisectoral action to end TB 2. Urgently increase funding for essential TB services including the health workforce 3. Advance universal health coverage to ensure all people with TB have access to affordable quality care, and resolve underreporting challenges 4. Address the drug-resistant TB crisis to close persistent gaps in care 5. Dramatically scale up provision of preventive treatment for TB 6. Promote human rights and combat stigma and discrimination 7. Ensure meaningful engagement of civil society, communities and people affected by TB 8. Substantially increase investments in TB research to drive technological breakthroughs and the rapid uptake of innovations 9. Ensure that TB prevention and care are safeguarded in the context of COVID-19 and other emerging threats 10. Request WHO to continue to provide global leadership for the TB response, working in close collaboration with Member States and other stakeholders, including to prepare for a high-level meeting on TB in 2023 that aligns with the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on universal health coverage also to be held in 2023 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 xxi

For children, the combined total was 1.04 million (about 0.5 million in each year), 30% of the way towards the cumulative 5-year target of 3.5 million. A total of 42 countries, including 13 of the 30 high TB FIG. 2.6 burden countries, reported that the number of people The global number of people reported to have treated for TB increased by 10% or more between 2017 and been treated for TB disease, 2015–2019 2019, while TB incidence in these countries was estimated to have slowly declined. Increases in absolute terms were particularly large in two high TB burden countries, India and Indonesia, at 513 000 people (+31%) and 120 000 peo- ple (+27%), respectively. Among the other 30 high TB bur- den countries, high levels of treatment coverage4 (>80%) have already been achieved in Brazil, China and the Rus- sian Federation. The total number of people treated for MDR/RR-TB in 2018–2019, at 333 304 (Fig. 2.7), was 22% of the way towards the 5-year target of 1.5 million (Fig. 2.8). For children, the total was 8986, less than 10% of the 5-year target of 115 000. In 70 countries, the number of people reported to have been enrolled in treatment for MDR/RR-TB increased by 10% or more between 2017 and 2019. The five countries with the biggest increases in absolute numbers were (in descending order) India, China, the Russian Federation, Indonesia and Angola. Of the 30 high MDR-TB burden countries, those with the smallest gaps between the esti- mated number of incident cases of MDR/RR-TB and the number of people enrolled on treatment in 2019 included Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Peru, Republic of Mol- dova, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Ukraine. 1 On the assumption that all people diagnosed with TB who were officially notified to WHO were treated. Additional people whose TB diagnosis was not notified to national authorities and report- ed to WHO may also have been treated. 2 MDR-TB is defined as resistance to rifampicin (RR-TB) and iso- niazid, the two most effective first-line anti-TB drugs. WHO rec- ommends a treatment regimen that includes second-line drugs for people with MDR/RR-TB. 3 Additional people whose diagnosis of MDR/RR-TB was not noti- fied to national authorities and reported to WHO may also have been enrolled on treatment, 4 That is, the number of people started on treatment divided by the estimated number of incident cases in the same year.

WHO gathers data for people living with HIV and household contacts. The number of people provided with TB preventive treat- ment has increased in recent years, from 1.0 million in 2015 to 2.2 million in 2018 and 4.1 million in 2019 (Fig. 2.9). Most of those provided with TB preventive treatment were people living with HIV: 1.8 million in 2018 and 3.5 million in 2019. India and South Africa accounted for 25% and 18% of the combined total for 2018–2019, respectively. Numbers for household contacts have been much smaller: 423 607 in 2018 and 538 396 in 2019. This includ- ed a total of 782 952 children aged under 5 years (349 796 in 2018 and 433 156 in 2019) and 179 051 people in old- er age groups (73 811 in 2018 and 105 240 in 2019). The WHO Region of the Americas and European Region had the highest coverage of treatment for contacts. The 6.3 million people started on TB preventive treat- ment in 2018 and 2019 was 21% of the way towards the 5-year target of 30 million (Fig. 2.10), with progress for household contacts lagging far behind. For people living with HIV, the subtarget of 6 million is on track to be met in 2020. 10 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 snoilliM 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 People living with HIV Contacts aged under 5 years Contacts aged 5 years and above (or age unspecified) 2.6 Funding for universal access to TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care Funding for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care in 121 low- and middle-income countries has reached US$ 6.5 billion in 2020, up from US$ 6.1 billion in 2017 and US$ 5.6 billion in 2015 (Fig. 2.11).1 Even allowing for the fact that there will have been additional funding in the remaining 14 low- and middle-income countries, and in high-income countries, funding falls far short of the UN high-level meeting target of at least US$ 13 billion per year by 2022; to reach the target, funding needs to approx- imately double. Overall, most funding (85%) comes from domestic sources. However, aggregate figures are strongly influ- enced by the BRICS group of countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa). The BRICS countries account for 57% of available funding in 2020, 97% of which is from domestic sources. In other low- and middle-income countries, international donor funding remains crucial; in 2020, such funding accounted for 44% of the funding available in the 25 high TB burden coun- tries outside BRICS and 57% of funding in low-income countries. Since 2015, funding from international donors has been about US$ 1 billion per year, with about 70% of this total coming from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber- culosis and Malaria (Global Fund).2 The recent commit- ment to replenish this fund means that more than 110 1 Further details are provided in Chapter 7. 2 Further details about international donor funding for TB are provided in Box 7.1 of Chapter 7.

The largest bilateral donor is the United States (US) government. 2.7 Funding for TB research Funding for TB research has grown in recent years; it reached US$ 906 million in 2018, up from US$ 772 mil- lion in 2017 (Fig. 2.12) (8). However, this amount was less than half of the UN high-level meeting target of US$ 2 billion per year. The two largest investors in 2018 were the US govern- ment and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which together accounted for 56% of total funding. The 30 largest funders accounted for 90% of the total. About one third of TB research funding was for drug research, followed by 20% for basic science, 13% for operational research, 12% for vaccines, and 9% each for diagnostics and infrastruc- ture or unspecified research. 2.8 Summary Progress towards TB targets has been made at global, regional and national levels. However, worldwide, none of the targets is on track to be achieved (Fig. 2.13). Of great concern is the fact that progress made by the end of 2019 could be reversed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the subject of the next chapter.

Chapter 3 The COVID-19 pandemic and TB – impact and implications Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has FIG. 3.1 caused enormous health, social and economic impacts, Estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which are likely to continue in 2021 and beyond. Even after on the global number of TB deaths for some of these impacts have been mitigated or contained, different combinations of decreases in case there will be medium- and longer-term consequences, detection and the duration of these decreases including for the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic and response. The pandemic threatens to reverse the progress made towards global TB targets by the end of 2019 (Chapter 2). This chapter discusses the predicted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global annual number of TB 1.3 deaths and the global annual number of people develop- 1.2 ing TB disease in 2020 and beyond, based on modelling; 1.1 and how the proportion of TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs may be affected. It also summarizes 1 evidence about impacts on access to and delivery of essen- 0.9 tial TB services and the allocation of human, financial 0.8 and other resources in 2020, based on data gathered by 0.7 the World Health Organization (WHO) from national TB programmes (NTPs) as part of the 2020 round of global 0.6 TB data collection (Chapter 1). The last section summa- 0.5 rizes actions taken by the WHO Global TB Programme to 0.4 support NTPs and identifies the potential for synergies in 0.3 responding to both TB and COVID-19. The chapter is an expanded version of Section IV of the 0.2 UN Secretary-General’s 2020 progress report on TB (1), 0.1 which was prepared with WHO support as requested in the political declaration of the UN high-level meeting on Decrease in case detection (%) TB held in September 2018 (2). 3.1 Global annual number of TB deaths in 2020 and beyond Two modelling analyses have reached similar conclusions about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global TB deaths (3, 4). They suggest that the annual num- ber could rise to the levels seen in 2015 or even 2012. The WHO analysis assessed the additional number of TB deaths that could occur globally for different combinations of a decrease in case detection (compared with levels before the pandemic) and the number of months for which this decrease occurs (Fig. 3.1). If the number of people with TB detected and treated were to fall by 25–50% over a period of 3 months – a range considered plausi- ble based on data from several high TB burden countries (Fig 3.2, Fig. 3.3) – there could be between 200 000 and 400 000 excess TB deaths.1 1 It is also possible that TB could worsen outcomes in people with COVID-19.

People in all age groups are affected by TB, but the highest burden is among adult men, who account- ed for 56% of all cases in 2019, compared with 32% of cases in adult women and 12% in children.1 The higher share of TB cases among men is consistent with evidence from prevalence surveys, which show that TB disease affects men more than women, and that gaps in case detection and reporting are higher among men (Section 4.4). The M:F ratio of incident TB cases for all ages ranged from 1.3 in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region to 2.1 in the European and Western Pacific regions. In chil- dren, the global M:F ratio was close to 1. 4.1.4 Estimated trends in TB incidence, 2000–2019 Consistent with previous global TB reports, the number of incident cases is falling slowly, in both absolute terms and per capita (Fig. 4.9). Globally, the average rate of decline in the TB incidence rate was 1.7% per year in the period 2000−2019, and 2.3% per year in 2018–2019. This is much too slow to reach the End TB Strategy milestone of a 20% reduction between 2015 and 2020 (see right panel of Globally, the reduction in TB incidence between 2015 Fig. 4.9 and left panel of Fig. 4.10).

This continuous decline was in large part attributable to the substantial rise in ART coverage in Africa, from an estimated 24% of people living with HIV in 2010 to 51% in 2015 and almost 70% in 2019. Annual declines in incidence since 2015 have been much slower in the WHO regions of the Eastern Medi- terranean (0.9% per year), South-East Asia (2.3% per year) and the Western Pacific (1.5% per year), with cumula- tive reductions of 3.5%, 8.7% and 6.1%, respectively, for the period 2015–2019. Of concern is the WHO Region of the Americas, where incidence is estimated to be slow- ly increasing after many years of decline, owing to an upward trend in Brazil during 2016–2019. A total of 78 countries are on track to reach the mile- stone of a 20% reduction in TB incidence between 2015 and 2020. Of the 30 high TB burden countries, seven have already reached this milestone (Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ken- ya, Namibia, the Russian Federation, South Africa and 1 Further details are provided in Box 3.4 of the 2018 global TB report (14).

Faster reductions in other countries will require improvements in access to TB diagnosis and care within the context of progress towards UHC, action on broad- er determinants (e.g. levels of undernutrition, poverty, smoking and diabetes), and a new treatment or vaccine to substantially lower the risk of developing TB in people who already have a latent TB infection. These topics are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9. 4.2 TB mortality Deaths from TB among HIV-negative people are classified as TB deaths in the 10th edition of the International Clas- sification of Diseases (ICD-10) (15). When an HIV-posi- tive person dies from TB, the underlying cause is classified as HIV. For consistency with international classifications, this section makes a clear distinction between TB deaths in HIV-negative people and TB deaths in HIV-positive people. The milestones and targets for reductions in TB deaths set in the End TB Strategy are for the combined total of deaths in HIV-positive and HIV-negative people; illustrations of progress towards the 2020 milestone in this chapter are presented accordingly.

India accounted for 36% of global TB deaths among HIV-negative people, and for 31% of the combined total number of TB deaths in HIV-negative and HIV-positive people. Estimates of TB mortality rates (deaths per 100 000 population per year) are shown globally, for the six WHO regions and 30 high TB burden countries, in Table 4.4. Globally, the number of TB deaths among HIV-nega- tive people per 100 000 population was 16 (range, 15–17) in 2019, and 18 (range, 17–20) when TB deaths among HIV-positive people were included. There was consider- able variation among countries (Fig. 4.17), ranging from less than one TB death per 100 000 population in many high-income countries, to 40 or more deaths per 100 000 population in much of the WHO African Region and in two other high TB burden countries (the Democratic Peo- ple’s Republic of Korea and Papua New Guinea).

In Table 4.7, estimates are shown for HIV-positive and HIV-negative people separately, given that the cause of TB deaths among HIV-positive peo- ple is classified as HIV in ICD-10 (estimates in Fig 4.18, Fig. 4.19 and Fig. 4.20 are for HIV-negative people only). Globally in 2019, 53% of the HIV-negative people who died from TB were men, 31% were women and 16% were children (aged <15 years). The higher share for children compared with their estimated share of cases (12%) sug- gests poorer access to diagnosis and treatment. Globally in 2019, 47% of the HIV-positive people who died from TB were men, 36% were women and 17% were children. 4.2.4 Estimated trends in TB mortality, 2000–2019 Global trends in the absolute number of TB deaths in HIV-negative and HIV-positive people and the mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 population per year) are shown in Fig. 4.21. The absolute number of TB deaths among HIV-negative people fell 31% between 2000 and 2019, from a best estimate of 1.7 million in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2019, and the mortality rate fell by 45% (including 3.7% between 2018 and 2019).

FIG. 4.22 Trends in estimated TB mortality rates by WHO region, 2000−2019 Estimated TB mortality rates among HIV-negative people are shown in blue and estimated mortality rates among HIV-positive people are shown in red. Shaded areas represent uncertainty intervals. As noted in Section 4.1.4, this needs to include mul- tisectoral action on the broader determinants of TB inci- dence (e.g. levels of undernutrition, poverty, smoking and diabetes) and investment in research to develop a new treatment or vaccine to substantially lower the risk of developing TB in people who already have a latent TB infection. 4.2.5 The case fatality ratio The CFR is the proportion of people with TB who die from the disease; it can be approximated as the number of TB deaths divided by the number of new cases in the same year. The CFR allows the assessment of variation in equity in terms of access to TB diagnosis and treatment among countries (because, if everyone with TB had access to timely diagnosis and high-quality treatment, the CFR would be low in all countries). Achieving the End TB Strategy 2020 milestone of a 35% reduction in TB deaths for the period 2015–2020 requires a reduction in the global CFR, from 17% in 2015 to 10% in 2020. In 2019, the global CFR (calculated as the com- bined number of TB deaths in HIV-negative people and HIV-positive people, divided by the total number of inci- dent cases in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive peo- 48 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 raey rep noitalupop 000 001 rep etar ytilatroM Africa The Americas Eastern Mediterranean 20 75 3 15 50 2 10 25 1 5 0 0 0 Europe South−East Asia Western Pacific 8 60 6 10 40 4 5 20 2 0 0 0 2000 2005 2010 2015 2000 2005 2010 2015 2000 2005 2010 2015 ple)1 was 14%, down from 23% in 2000 and 16% in 2015. It varied widely among countries (Fig. 4.26), from less than 5% in a few countries to more than 20% in most coun- tries in the WHO African Region. Intensified efforts are required to reduce the CFR. 4.2.6 Estimated number of deaths averted by TB treatment, 2000–2019 To estimate the number of deaths averted by TB inter- ventions, the actual numbers of TB deaths (presented in Section 4.2) can be compared with the number of TB deaths that would have occurred in the absence of TB treat- ment (and without ART provided alongside TB treatment for HIV-positive cases). The latter number can be estimated conservatively as the number of estimated incident cases (Section 4.1) multiplied by the relevant estimated CFR for 1 The CFR was calculated based on the combined total of deaths in HIV-negative and HIV-positive people for the purpose of cross-country comparisons; in particular, to illustrate the high CFRs in African countries, which could be reduced by effective detection and care programmes. CFRs restricted to HIV-negative TB deaths and cases can also be calculated but are not shown here. At the subnational level, CFRs can also be restricted to HIV-nega- tive TB deaths, depending on the country and its HIV burden.

In most countries, the ratio was in the range 2–4, with generally higher ratios in Asia than in Africa. The ratio of prevalence to notifications (P:N)1 can be used to assess detection and reporting gaps (Fig. 4.38a) and variation in these gaps by sex (Fig. 4.38b). The P:N ratios from the 33 surveys implemented in 2007–2019 suggest that these gaps are marginally higher in Asia than in Africa. The data also suggest that women are access- ing available diagnostic and treatment services more effectively than men. The higher disease burden in men, combined with larger gaps in detection and reporting, indicates a need for strategies to improve access to and use of health services among men (19). 1 The unit of the P:N ratio is expressed in years.

Prevalence shows the following: estimates are from a cross-sectional survey, and therefore only represent one point in time. Notification data are from the main year of the survey. ▶ there was impressive standardization and consistency in the case definitions used, and the type of data col- lected, according to the WHO recording and reporting framework (27 countries met the first two standards). ▶ the completeness of reporting of data from lower administrative levels (e.g. districts, provinces) to the national level requires improvement in many coun- tries. Reporting was complete (100% of expected reports received at the national level ) in only 10 of the 29 countries. 1 The exception is China, where a partial assessment has been com- pleted (Table 4.2).

When the external consistency standard was not met, it was most- ly due to underreporting of childhood TB, which poses well-recognized challenges (Box 4.2). This situation sug- gests that systematic issues exist in terms of the diagnosis and reporting of TB in children (standard B2.3). ▶ significant gaps remain with the coverage of the TB surveillance system (only the Russian Federation met standard B1.8) and overall access to health care (stand- ard B1.9). ▶ only Brazil and the Russian Federation have national VR systems with standard coding of causes of death, good coverage and high-quality data (standard B1.10).1 ▶ surveillance of drug-resistant TB is of high quality in 13 VR, vital registration; DR, drug-resistant TB countries and of medium quality in six (standard B2.1). a The number of countries is shown within the bars; Standard B1.4 was not applicable in 9 countries; standard B1.5 was not applicable in 14 countries; the high ▶ surveillance of HIV infection among TB patients is of TB burden country for which full results are not available is China. high-quality in 17 countries and of medium quality in an additional five (standard B2.2). Results from repeat assessments of the performance of TB surveillance generally show that progress is being made (Fig. 4.40). Of the 41 countries where a repeat assessment has been completed, 30 made a net improvement (in terms of their overall score); among the remaining 11 countries, there was no change in five and a deterioration in six. Rea- sons for the latter included a worsening in internal con- sistency, the coverage of testing for drug-resistant TB and the coverage of the TB surveillance system. Of the 19 high TB burden countries that completed a repeat assessment, 17 made a net improvement; there was no change in Zimbabwe and a deterioration in Lesotho (the internal and external consistency of data worsened and there was evidence of increasing financial barriers to accessing health care). Other findings from repeat assessments in high TB burden countries were that: ▶ standardization of case definitions and the type of data collected based on the WHO definitions and reporting framework for TB was maintained or improved; ▶ strong improvements were made in the completeness of data reporting from lower to higher administrative lev- els, and in the internal consistency of surveillance data; 1 Mortality data from VR systems or mortality surveys are available for a further seven countries (Table 4.2), and were used for the country-specific estimates of TB mortality included in this report.

The top-five priority recommendations from TB sur- veillance assessments (and the national TB epidemiolog- ical reviews of which they are almost always a part) are shown in Table 4.12. As part of the work of the WHO Global Task Force on TB Impact Measurement (Box 4.1), a comprehensive background document about the key findings and recom- mendations from the 82 countries where an assessment has been carried out is in preparation, and will provide the basis for a second edition of the TB surveillance checklist (in 2021). A new product – standardized coun- try profiles to highlight key results and recommendations from each assessment – is also in development. The aim is that NTPs and their partners can use these profiles to help inform investments and actions to strengthen TB surveillance.

The biggest gaps – where more than half of the people with HIV-associated TB were not reported – were in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean (75% gap), Western Pacific (57% gap) and African regions (51% gap). Globally, the estimated percentage of people living with HIV who knew their HIV status reached 81% in 2019. To enhance patient follow-up and reduce the higher mortality rates in this population, there is a need for more intensified TB case-finding among people attending HIV care services, and for strengthened linkages between TB and HIV recording and reporting systems. In 2020, WHO released new guidelines on strategic information related to HIV (7). The guidelines include five indicators for identifying and addressing gaps in the TB screening and diagnostic cascade; these indicators are applicable in all countries but are considered a particular priority in high TB/HIV burden countries. Adoption and use of these indicators should help to improve TB case detection among people living with HIV. 86 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 )snoillim( raey rep sesac espaler dna weN 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 2019 Year a The calculation is for all cases in years prior to 2015.

MDR-TB is TB that is resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective anti-TB drugs.1 All forms of drug-resistant TB require treatment with a second-line regimen (11). With increasing use of Xpert MTB/RIF for simultaneous detection of TB and resistance to rifampicin, a growing number of RR-TB cases are being detected and notified. The End TB Strategy calls for universal access to drug susceptibility testing (DST). The focus in this section is on DST for notified TB patients with bacteriologically con- firmed TB, who can then be tested for MDR/RR-TB, using diagnostic tests recommended by WHO. DST for first-line drugs and detection of MDR/RR-TB There has been considerable progress in increasing the coverage of DST, especially since 2012 (Fig. 5.15).2 Glob- ally in 2019, 2.2 million (61%) of the 3.6 million bacterio- logically confirmed pulmonary TB cases notified globally The global number of MDR/RR-TB cases notified in were tested for rifampicin resistance, up from 1.7 million 2019 was 44% of the estimated 465 000 MDR/RR-TB (51%) in 2018 and 0.2 million (7%) in 2012.

The biggest increase was in the WHO es with bacteriological confirmation (Section 5.1.3) and Western Pacific Region (50% to 75%). Coverage ranged coverage of diagnostic DST (Box 4.3).

This followed a ministerial confer- ence for high MDR-TB burden countries, held in Beijing, China, in April 2009; a World Health Assembly resolution was adopted the following month (12).

Only six countries (Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia) had transitioned to using the 3HP regimen; 14 recommended at least 6 months of isoniazid monotherapy as the only treatment option. In 2020, WHO released updated consolidated guidance on HIV strategic information (the previous guidelines were published in 2015) (9). These guidelines aim to strengthen the ability of national programmes to identify and close gaps in service access, coverage and quality across the HIV services cascade. There are 15 core national HIV indicators, Despite progress, there are still considerable gaps in two of which are “initiation of TB preventive treatment” screening for TB, detection of TB and provision of TB pre- and “completion of TB preventive treatment among people ventive treatment among people living with HIV, even in living with HIV”.

In high TB burden countries, testing for TB infection is not a requirement for initiation of TB preventive treatment, such that all those without active TB disease are eligible for TB preventive treatment. b The gap represents people living with HIV who should have undergone complete evaluation for TB disease or TB preventive treatment.

In 2018, global funding targets for TB were set for the first time, as part of the political declaration at the United Nations (UN) high-level meeting on TB held in Septem- ber 2018 (Chapter 2) (5). The targets are to mobilize at least US$ 13 billion annually by 2022 for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and an additional US$ 2 billion annually for TB research in the 5-year period 2018–2022.

FIG. 7.3 Funding for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment in total and by category of expenditurea, 121 countries with 98% of reported cases, 2006–2020 stant 2020 US dollars). Despite this growth in funding, the amount in 2020 is only half of what the Global Plan estimates is needed (Fig. 7.1) and only half of the 2022 target set at the UN high-level meeting on TB (Fig. 7.4). Of the total of US$ 6.5 billion available in 2020, US$ 4.2 billion (65%) is for diagnosis and treatment of drug-sus- ceptible TB.1 This is just over half of what the Global Plan estimates is needed for 2020 (US$ 8.3 billion). Funding for MDR-TB reached US$ 2.26 billion in 2020, a large increase from the US$ 1.4 billion available in 2015 (Fig. 7.3). This growth is largely explained by trends in the BRICS group of countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa) (Fig. 7.5), which account for 77% of total funding for MDR-TB in the period 2015–2020, and 58% of the total number of people with MDR-TB who were diagnosed and reported in 2019. Nonetheless, the US$ 2.26 billion available for MDR-TB in 2020 overall is only just over half of the US$ 4.3 billion that the Global Plan estimates is required in that year. In 2020, 66 countries reported funding gaps for MDR- TB, with the largest gaps reported by China (US$ 109 mil- lion), Indonesia (US$ 70 million) and Pakistan (US$ 55 million) (Fig. 7.10). In addition, the funding required for MDR-TB will continue to increase (Fig. 7.1), reach- ing an estimated US$ 5.7 billion in 2022 – nearly triple the amount available in 2020. The need for more funding is evident in the persistently large gaps in detecting and treating people with MDR-TB.2 1 This includes funding for diagnostic testing using the Xpert MTB/RIF® or Xpert Ultra assays, which simultaneously test for TB and rifampicin resistance. 2 Further details are provided in Chapter 2 and Chapter 5. 132 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 )$SU 0202 tnatsnoc( snoilliB FIG. 7.4 Funding for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment in 121 low- and middle-income countries compared with the global target set at the UN high-level meeting on TB of at least US$ 13 billion per year by 2022 8 The 121 countries accounted for 98% of the world’s officially reported TB cases in 2019.

However, aggregated figures for the 121 low- and middle-income countries are strongly influenced by the BRICS group of countries, and they conceal sub- stantial variation among countries in the share of funding from domestic and international sources (Fig. 7.7). The BRICS group of countries account for US$ 3.7 bil- lion (57%) of the total of US$ 6.5 billion available in 2020 (and 47% of the world’s TB cases) and overall, 97% of funding is from domestic sources (81% in South Africa, 92% in India, and 100% in Brazil, China and the Russian Federation). In India, there was an impressive increase in the TB-specific budget, and in domestic funding for this budget, from 2016 to 2019, although both amounts are expected to fall from 2019 to 2020 (Fig. 7.8). India’s nation- al TB budget in 2020 is almost double what it was in 2016, and domestic funding for this budget in 2020 is 3.7 times the level it was in 2016 (and 13 times the level of 2006). 3 Domestic funding includes both funding for TB-specific budg- ets, and funding for inpatient and outpatient care (usually fund- ed through more general budget lines), as explained in the online technical appendix. In Fig. 7.6 and Fig. 7.7, it is assumed that funding for inpatient and outpatient care is provided domesti- cally rather than by international donors. This is justified on the basis that middle-income countries account for most (92%) of the funding estimated to be used for inpatient and outpatient care for TB patients (estimated at US$1.6 billion in 2020), where inter- national donor funding for such components of care is unlikely (such support is more likely to occur in low-income countries, via general budget support to the health sector).

FIG. 7.5 Funding for drug-susceptible TB and MDR-TB by country groupa, 2006–2020 a BRICS (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa) accounted for 47% of the total number of TB cases notified globally in 2019.

Of this amount, 77% is from the Global Fund. The importance of international donor funding in high TB burden countries is particularly evident when consid- ering only the TB-specific budgets included in national strategic plans for TB (Fig. 7.9, Table 7.1 and Table 7.2). 1 The list of 30 high TB burden countries used by WHO during the period 2016–2020 is explained in Annex 2. The countries are listed in Fig. 7.9, Table 7.1 and Table 7.2. 2 For further details, see the online country profiles and the Global TB Report 2020 app (Annex 3). 3 The reported international donor funding is based on reported received amounts, except for a handful of countries (e.g. Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa) that did not report expenditure data in 2020 or previous years. For these countries, imputed amounts that account for committed international funding were used instead.

FIG. 7.11 Estimated cost per patient treated for drug-susceptible TB in 112 countries,a 2019 a Limited to countries with at least 100 patients on first-line treatment in 2019. 7.4 Unit costs of treatment for drug- susceptible TB and MDR-TB, 2019 The cost per patient treated in 2019 for drug-susceptible TB and MDR-TB was estimated for 112 countries and 89 countries, respectively.1 All 30 countries in the lists of high TB burden countries and high MDR-TB burden countries (except for Uzbekistan, which did not report data in 2020) were included in the analyses.2 Unit cost estimates are shown in Fig. 7.11 and Fig. 7.12, and analytical methods are described in the online technical appendix.3 7.4.1 Drug-susceptible TB The median cost per person treated for drug-susceptible TB in 2019 was US$ 860.4 In general, about 71% of this cost was accounted for by expenditures reported by NTPs, with the remainder being WHO-estimated costs for inpa- tient and outpatient care. There was a positive relationship between the cost per person treated and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and a negative relationship between the cost and the size of the patient caseload (indi- cating economies of scale; e.g. in China, India and Indo- nesia). In all but one of the 30 high TB burden countries included in the analysis, the cost per person treated for drug-susceptible TB was less than the GDP per capita; the exception was Sierra Leone. 1 Analysis for drug-susceptible TB was limited to countries that notified at least 100 TB cases in 2019; for MDR-TB, estimates were restricted to countries that reported at least 20 patients on second-line treatment for MDR-TB in 2019. 2 For further details about both lists, see Annex 2. 3 The online appendix is available here: http://www.who.int/tb/ publications/global_report/ 4 Median values are cited rather than means because of a few countries with extreme values.

These countries, which are all in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), have relatively high costs due to extensive use of hospitalization for patients in the intensive phase of treatment and a relatively long length of stay for people treated in hospital (an average of 58 days per person in 2019). High programme costs rela- tive to a smaller pool of patients (i.e. <3000 people in 2019) also help to explain comparatively high per-person costs in some countries (e.g. in Belarus, Bulgaria and Serbia, the unit cost was US$ 17 133, US$ 13 254 and US$ 10 018, respectively; in Bulgaria and Serbia, the cost was higher than GDP per capita). It is also evident that some EECA countries have markedly reduced their use of hospitalization and have changed their model of care for people with drug-suscep- tible TB. From 2014 to 2019, 13 of the 15 EECA countries reduced the number of bed days per person. The size of the reduction (which is influenced by both the percentage of people with drug-susceptible TB who are hospitalized and the average length of stay if hospitalized) ranged from 21% in the Republic of Moldova to 81% in the Russian Federation (where the proportion of people with TB who were hospitalized fell from 93% to 69%, and the average length of stay if hospitalized fell from 75 to 19 days). In Kazakhstan, which has the second-highest number of cas- es among EECA countries after the Russian Federation, the number of bed days per person with drug-susceptible TB fell by 25%.

This may reflect a general transition to using new treatment regimens for MDR-TB and a shift to models of care that are less reliant on inpatient care. As with drug-susceptible TB, the cost per person treated was positively correlated with GDP per capita. Excluding China and the Russian Federation – for which inpatient and outpatient care costs are not report- ed separately from other components of TB diagnosis and treatment – in the remaining 87 countries, 44% of the unit cost was accounted for by second-line TB drugs and 31% was accounted for by inpatient care.

The average length of stay fell in 72% (64/89) of countries. The most drastic reductions were in Nicaragua (–92%, from 180 days to 15 days), Pakistan (–85%, from 100 to 15 days), Mauritania (–88% from 120 days to 14 days) and Armenia (–85%, from 240 days to 36 days). In contrast, the average length of stay increased in several countries, including Kenya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Peru, Philippines and Thailand.

There was little change over time in high-income countries. National values for the SCI in 2017 are shown in Fig. 8.2. There was a great deal of variation among coun- tries. The highest values were in high-income countries in Asia, Europe and North America. The lowest values were predominantly in countries in the WHO African Region; other countries with values below 40 were Afghanistan and Somalia. SCI values in 2017 in the 30 high TB burden countries were mostly in the range of 40–60 (Table 8.1), showing that much remains to be done to achieve UHC in these settings. However, higher values in Brazil (79), Chi- na (79) and Thailand (80) are encouraging. 8.1.2 Proportion of the general population incurring catastrophic expenditures on health In contrast to improvements in the SCI, the proportion of the general population facing catastrophic expendi- tures on health has increased in recent years. Globally, the proportion of households that incurred expenditures on health that were above 10% of their income or expenditure rose from 9.4% in 2010 to 12.7% (927 million people) in 2015.1 National values are shown in Fig. 8.3. More geo- graphical variability is evident for this indicator than for the SCI, including within regions. Countries in the highest category for catastrophic expenditures on health (≥15% of the general population) include those that rank first (India) and third (China) in terms of their total number of TB cases, as well as five oth- er high TB burden countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambo- dia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Overall, in high TB burden countries, the median value during the period 2007–2018 was 4.9% (Table 8.1). 1 Global estimates for later years are not yet available.

One example of the latter is Mozambique, for which the value of the SCI was 46 while the estimated proportion of households facing catastrophic expenditures on health was 1.6% (based on data for 2014). Countries may have low levels of direct spending on health because there are geographic, finan- cial or other barriers to access. Low levels of service cov- erage and low levels of catastrophic health spending are most likely a signal of high levels of unmet need rather than good financial protection. Thailand stands out as a high TB burden country with both a high SCI (80) and a low level of catastrophic health expenditures (2% of households). A UHC scheme was established in 2002, supported by domestic funding and a strong primary health care system (15). 8.1.3 Current health expenditure per capita SDG Target 3.c urges Member States to substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, develop- ment, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries. Without such investment, UHC will not be achieved. Trends in health expenditure (from all sources) per capita over the period 2000–2017 in the 30 high TB bur- den countries are shown in Fig. 8.4. There was a striking increase in the absolute amount of spending per person in a few countries: Brazil, China, the Russian Federa- tion, South Africa and Thailand. A steady upward trend was evident in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam; also, despite some year-to-year fluctuation, funding in Namibia doubled. Since about 2012, there has been a noticeable rise in health expenditure per capita in Myanmar. Elsewhere, levels of spending have been rela- tively stable, and at generally much lower levels.

BOX 8.1 The difference between “catastrophic total costs” for TB patients and their households, and the SDG indicator of catastrophic expenditures on health care It is important to distinguish between the indicator Due to the nature of the illness, TB patients and of “the proportion of the population with large their households can face severe direct and indirect household expenditures on health as a share of financial and economic costs.

The framework was based on previously published work that identified clear linkages between TB incidence and various indicators that are part of the SDG framework (3-6), and new analysis of the rela- tionship between these indicators and TB incidence. The TB-SDG framework comprises 14 indicators under sev- en SDGs (Table 8.2). The relationship between two of the indicators (GDP per capita and the prevalence of under- nutrition) and TB incidence is illustrated in Fig. 8.8. The framework includes only indicators for which a relationship with TB incidence could be established. It excludes: ▶ subindicators of indicators that have already been included (e.g. subindicators related to UHC, under SDG 3); and ▶ indicators that are only remotely associated with TB risks, and that operate mainly through other SDGs (e.g. education under SDG 4, gender equality under SDG 5 and resilient infrastructure under SDG 9). In some cases, the official SDG indicator was not con- sidered the best metric, and a better (but closely related) alternative was identified and justified (five indicators under SDG 3, one under SDG 8 and one under SDG 10). The most recent data on the prevalence of four health-re- lated risk factors (diabetes, HIV infection, smoking and alcohol use disorders) under SDG 3 that are associated with TB incidence (Table 8.2a) as well as undernutrition (Table 8.2b) are shown for the 30 high TB burden coun- tries in Table 8.3.1 For all of the indicators shown, a lower level is more desirable. 1 The three indicators relating to coverage of health services and health expenditure per capita are not included here because they are discussed in Section 8.1. 156 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 9102 ni noitalupop 000 001 rep ecnedicnI GDP per capita (US$ thousands in 2018) 100 10 1 3 10 30 9102 ni noitalupop 000 001 rep ecnedicnI Prevalence of undernutrition (% of population in 2017) The countries with generalized HIV epidemics (a prev- alence of >1% in the general population) include 15 of the 16 high TB burden countries in the WHO African Region (the exception is the Democratic Republic of the Congo), with especially high levels in southern Africa (24% in Lesotho, 13% in Mozambique, 12% in Namibia, 20% in South Africa, 11% in Zambia and 13% in Zimbabwe). The prevalence of smoking in adult men (aged ≥15 years) is above 40% in six of the 30 high TB burden coun- tries and is exceptionally high (60%) in Indonesia and Lesotho; the only countries where it is below 20% are Brazil, Ethiopia, Liberia and Nigeria. Smoking is much less common among adult women, with levels below 5% in most high TB burden countries and exceeding 10% only in the Russian Federation. These striking differences between men and women contribute to the higher burden of TB disease among men (Chapter 4).

In line with WHO’s global strategy for TB research and innovation, the WHO Global TB Programme has recently developed two other resources. One is a compen- dium of research related to TB and COVID-19 (Box 9.1); the other is a toolkit to support the implementation and scale-up of digital technologies across the TB continuum of care (Box 9.2). Both the compendium and the toolkit are expected to contribute to mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TB services. 9.2 New diagnostics for TB This section provides an overview of the TB diagnostics (Chapter 2).

A1.1 Database contents The 2020 global tuberculosis (TB) report is based on data collected annually from 215 countries and territories, includ- ing all 194 World Health Organization (WHO) Member States. The Global TB Programme has implemented annual rounds of data collection since 1995, with an online system used since 2009. Data are stored in a global TB database that is managed by the TB monitoring, evaluation and strategic information unit of the Global TB Programme, at WHO headquarters. The topics on which data have been collected have been consistent for many years. In 2020, as in previous years, data were collected on the following: TB case notifications and treatment outcomes, including breakdowns by TB case type, age, sex, HIV status and drug resistance; laboratory diagnostic services; monitoring and evaluation, including surveil- lance and surveys specifically related to drug-resistant TB; TB preventive therapy; digital systems; TB infection control; palliative care; engagement of all public and private care providers in TB prevention and care; community engagement; budgets of national TB control programmes (NTPs); use of general health services (hospitalization and outpatient visits) during treatment; and NTP expenditures. A shortened version of the online questionnaire was used for high-income countries (i.e. countries with a gross national income per capita of ≥US$ 12 376 in 2018, as defined by the World Bank)1 or low-incidence countries (defined as countries with an incidence rate of <20 cases per 100 000 population or <10 cases in total in 2018). Data were also collected from all countries and territories on two new topics in 2020: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TB services; and specific elements of the WHO multisectoral accountability framework for TB that were included in the political declaration at the 2018 UN high-level meeting on TB. The main round of data collection was implemented in April and May. At the end of July, the 30 high TB burden countries and selected other regional priority countries in the WHO regions of the Americas and Western Pacific were asked to report monthly notification data for the period January–June 2020, to allow assessment of trends in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries reported data via a dedicated website,2 which was opened for reporting in April 2020. Countries in the European Union submitted data on notifications and treatment outcomes to the TESSy system managed by the Euro- pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Data from TESSy were uploaded into the global TB database. Additional data about the provision of treatment for latent TB infection to people newly or currently enrolled in HIV care, detection of TB among people newly enrolled in HIV care, and provision of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive TB patients were collected by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). These data were jointly validated by UNAIDS and the WHO’s Global TB Programme and HIV department, and were uploaded into the global TB database. Following review and follow-up with countries, the data used for the main part of this report were those that were available on 10 August 2020. Table A1.1 shows the number of countries and territories that had reported data by 10 August 2020.

The CSV data files are the primary resource for anyone interested in conducting their own analyses of the records in the global TB database. Data reported by countries (e.g. time series for case notifications and treatment outcomes) and WHO’s estimates of TB disease burden can be downloaded as CSV files covering all years for which data are available. These CSV files can be imported into many applications (e.g. spreadsheets, databases and statistical analysis software). A data dictionary that defines each of the variables available in the CSV files is also available and can be downloaded. The CSV files are generated on-demand directly from the global TB database, and may therefore include updates received after publication of the global TB report. 1 www.who.int/tb/data GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 199

A1.3 Accessing TB data using the WHO Global Health Observatory The WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO)1 is a portal that provides access to data and analyses for monitoring the global health situation; it includes a data repository. Data from WHO’s global TB database can be viewed, filtered, aggregated and downloaded from within the GHO data repository.2 There is also an application programme interface (API)3 using the open data protocol. The API allows analysts and programmers to use GHO data directly in their software applications. 1 www.who.int/data/gho 2 www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/tuberculosis 3 www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api 200 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020

Annex 2 Lists of high-burden countries defined by WHO for the period 2016–2020 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2020 203

During the period 1998–2015, the concept of a high burden country (HBC) became familiar and widely used in the con- text of TB. In 2015, three HBC lists – for TB, HIV-associated TB and MDR-TB – were in use. In 2015, as part of the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (2000–2015) and Stop TB Strategy (2006–2016) to a new era of the Sustainable Development Goals (2016–2030) and End TB Strategy (2016–2035), the lists were revisited and updated. Following a wide consultation process (1), three new HBC lists were defined for the period 2016–2020: one for TB, one for MDR-TB and one for HIV-associated TB (Fig. A2.1, Table A2.1). Each list contains 30 countries (Table A2.1). These are defined as the top 20 countries in terms of the absolute number of estimated incident cases, plus the additional 10 countries with the most severe burden in terms of incidence rates per capita that do not already appear in the top 20 and that meet a minimum threshold in terms of their absolute numbers of incident cases (10 000 per year for TB, and 1000 per year for HIV-associated TB and MDR-TB). The lists were defined using the estimates of TB disease burden available in October 2015. Each list accounts for about 90% of the global bur- den, with most of this accounted for by the top 20 countries in each list. There is overlap among the three lists, but 48 countries appear in at least one of them. The 14 countries that are in all three lists (shown in the central diamond in Fig. A2.1) are Angola, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Thailand and Zimbabwe. These 14 countries accounted for 63% of the estimated global number of incident TB cases in 2019. The 30 high TB burden countries are given particular attention in the main body of this report. Where estimates of disease burden and assessment of progress in the response are for HIV-associated TB or MDR-TB specifically, the coun- tries in the other two lists are given particular attention. Country profiles for all countries are available online, including in the mobile app that accompanies the report (Annex 3). The lists will be reviewed and updated for the period 2021–2025. FIG.
