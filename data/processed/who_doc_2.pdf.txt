Foreword Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General World Health Organization Leaving no one behind in the march to a malaria-free world The scourge of malaria continues to strike hardest against pregnant women and children in Africa. The World malaria report 2019 includes a special section focused on the burden and consequences of the disease among these two most at-risk groups. It delivers a clear message: we must all do more to protect the most vulnerable in the fight against a disease that continues to claim more than 400 000 lives every year. Malaria in pregnancy compromises the mother’s health and puts her at greater risk of death. It impacts the health of the fetus, leading to prematurity and low birthweight, major contributors to neonatal and infant mortality. Last year, some 11 million pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa were infected with malaria and, consequently, nearly 900 000 children were born with a low birthweight. To protect pregnant women in Africa, WHO recommends the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and preventive antimalarial medicines. This report shows progress on both fronts. Still, nearly 40% of pregnant woman did not sleep under an ITN in 2018 and two thirds did not receive the recommended three or more doses of preventive therapy. Among children, efforts to expand access to preventive antimalarial medicines are bearing fruit. In Africa’s Sahel sub-region, WHO recommends seasonal malaria chemoprevention during the peak transmission season. More than 60% of children living in areas eligible for this preventive therapy received it in 2018. Sierra Leone is to be commended for becoming the first country in Africa to roll out intermittent preventive treatment in infants, another WHO-recommended approach for protecting young children in malaria-affected areas. Still, access to care for children showing signs of a fever remains too low. Country surveys show that nearly 40% of febrile children in sub-Saharan Africa are not taken for care with a trained medical provider. At least 10 countries that are part of the WHO “E-2020 initiative” are on track to reach the 2020 elimination milestone of our global malaria strategy. In 2015, all of these countries were malaria endemic; now they have either achieved zero indigenous malaria cases or are nearing the finish line. However, in recent years, global progress in reducing new malaria cases has levelled off. Most worrying of all, malaria is on the rise across some high-burden countries in Africa. Critical milestones of our global malaria strategy are likely to be missed. iv

In 2018, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched “High burden to high impact”, a new approach to prevent disease and save lives in the countries hardest hit by malaria. Replacing a “one size fits all” strategy, the approach calls for using the most effective tools in a more targeted way. I am very pleased to note that two countries – India and Uganda – have reported substantial reductions in malaria cases in 2018 over the previous year. In September, I issued a “Malaria Challenge”, calling for greater investment in the research and development of transformative new tools, technologies and approaches to accelerate progress in beating back this disease. Through a WHO-coordinated pilot progamme, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi recently introduced the world’s first malaria vaccine in selected areas. Evidence and experience from the programme will inform policy decisions on the vaccine’s potential wider use in Africa. With support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and from Unitaid, other promising tools are being tested, such as new types of ITNs and tools that target outdoor-biting mosquitoes. Achieving our common vision of a malaria-free world will also require enhanced action in other critical areas. We need affordable, people-centred health services. We need reliable and accurate surveillance and response systems. We need strategies that are tailored to local malaria- transmission settings. Stepped-up financing for the malaria response is essential. In 2018, total funding for malaria control and elimination reached an estimated US$ 2.7 billion, falling far short of the US$ 5 billion funding target of our global strategy. Through resolute, robust financing, political leadership and universal health coverage, we can defeat this disease once and for all. v 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

This year’s report at a glance REGIONAL AND GLOBAL TRENDS IN BURDEN OF MALARIA CASES AND DEATHS Malaria cases ■ In 2018, an estimated 228 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide (95% confidence interval [CI]: 206–258 million), compared with 251 million cases in 2010 (95% CI: 231–278 million) and 231 million cases in 2017 (95% CI: 211–259 million). ■ Most malaria cases in 2018 were in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region (213 million or 93%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region with 3.4% of the cases and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region with 2.1%. ■ Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa1 and India carried almost 85% of the global malaria burden. Six countries accounted for more than half of all malaria cases worldwide: Nigeria (25%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%), and Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Niger (4% each). ■ The incidence rate of malaria declined globally between 2010 and 2018, from 71 to 57 cases per 1000 population at risk. However, from 2014 to 2018, the rate of change slowed dramatically, reducing to 57 in 2014 and remaining at similar levels through to 2018. ■ The WHO South-East Asia Region continued to see its incidence rate fall – from 17 cases of the disease per 1000 population at risk in 2010 to five cases in 2018 (a 70% decrease). In the WHO African Region, case incidence levels also declined from 294 in 2010 to 229 in 2018, representing a 22% reduction. All other WHO regions recorded either little progress or an increase in incidence rate. The WHO Region of the Americas recorded a rise, largely due to increases in malaria transmission in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. ■ Between 2015 and 2018, only 31 countries, where malaria is still endemic, reduced case incidence significantly and were on track to reduce incidence by 40% or more by 2020. Without accelerated change, the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) milestones for morbidity in 2025 and 2030 will not be achieved. ■ Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite in the WHO African Region, accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018, as well as in the WHO South-East Asia Region (50%), the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (71%) and the WHO Western Pacific Region (65%). ■ Globally, 53% of the P. vivax burden is in the WHO South-East Asia Region, with the majority being in India (47%). P. vivax is the predominant parasite in the WHO Region of the Americas, representing 75% of malaria cases. Malaria deaths ■ In 2018, there were an estimated 405 000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 416 000 estimated deaths in 2017, and 585 000 in 2010. ■ Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria. In 2018, they accounted for 67% (272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide. 1 The full list of sub-Saharan countries is available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49; for all analyses conducted in this report and pertaining to malaria endemic sub-Saharan countries, Sudan is also included. xii

■ The WHO African Region accounted for 94% of all malaria deaths in 2018. Although this region was home to the highest number of malaria deaths in 2018, it also accounted for 85% of the 180 000 fewer global malaria deaths reported in 2018 compared with 2010. ■ Nearly 85% of global malaria deaths in 2018 were concentrated in 20 countries in the WHO African Region and India; Nigeria accounted for almost 24% of all global malaria deaths, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11%), the United Republic of Tanzania (5%), and Angola, Mozambique and Niger (4% each). ■ In 2018, only the WHO African Region and the WHO South-East Asia Region showed reductions in malaria deaths compared with 2010. The WHO African Region had the largest absolute reduction in malaria deaths, from 533 000 in 2010 to 380 000 in 2018. Despite these gains, the malaria mortality reduction rate has also slowed since 2016. MATERNAL, INFANT AND CHILD HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF MALARIA ■ In 2018, about 11 million pregnancies in moderate and high transmission sub-Saharan African countries would have been exposed to malaria infection. ■ In 2018, prevalence of exposure to malaria infection in pregnancy was highest in the West African subregion and Central Africa (each with 35%), followed by East and Southern Africa (20%). About 39% of these were in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. ■ The 11 million pregnant women exposed to malaria infections in 2018 delivered about 872 000 children with low birthweight (16% of all children with low birthweight in these countries), with West Africa having the highest prevalence of low birthweight children due to malaria in pregnancy. ■ Between 2015 and 2018 in 21 moderate to high malaria burden countries in the WHO African Region, the prevalence of anaemia in children under 5 years with a positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was double that of children with a negative RDT. In the children who were positive for malaria, 9% had severe anaemia and 54% had moderate anaemia; in contrast, in the children without malaria, only 1% had severe anaemia and 31% had moderate anaemia. ■ The countries with the highest percentage of severe anaemia among children aged under 5 years who were positive for malaria were Senegal (26%), Mali (16%), Guinea (14%) and Mozambique (12%). For most other countries, severe anaemia ranged from 5% to 10%. ■ Overall, about 24 million children were estimated to be infected with P. falciparum in 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa, and an estimated 1.8 million of them were likely to have severe anaemia. HIGH BURDEN TO HIGH IMPACT APPROACH ■ There were about 155 million malaria cases in the 11 high burden to high impact (HBHI) countries in 2018, compared with 177 million in 2010. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria accounted for 84 million (54%) of total cases. ■ Of the 10 highest burden countries in Africa, Ghana and Nigeria reported the highest absolute increases in cases of malaria in 2018 compared with 2017. The burden in 2018 was similar to that of 2017 in all other countries, apart from in Uganda and India, where there were reported reductions of 1.5 and 2.6 million malaria cases, respectively, in 2018 compared with 2017. ■ Malaria deaths reduced from about 400 000 in 2010 to about 260 000 in 2018, the largest reduction being in Nigeria, from almost 153 000 deaths in 2010 to about 95 000 deaths in 2018. xiii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

■ By 2018, in all of the 11 HBHI countries, at least 40% of the population at risk were sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), the highest percentage being in Uganda (80%) and the lowest in Nigeria (40%). ■ Only Burkina Faso and the United Republic of Tanzania were estimated as having more than half of pregnant women receiving three doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp3) in 2018. In Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda, the estimated coverage was about 30% or less. ■ Six countries in Africa’s Sahel subregion implemented seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in 2018; a mean total of 17 million children, out of the 26 million targeted, were treated per SMC cycle. ■ The percentage of children aged under 5 years with fever seeking treatment varied from 58% in Mali to 82% in Uganda. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali, more than 40% of children were not brought for care at all. Testing was also worryingly low in children who were brought for care, with 30% or less being tested in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. ■ Except for India, direct domestic investment remains very low relative to international funding in the HBHI countries. MALARIA ELIMINATION AND PREVENTION OF RE‑ESTABLISHMENT ■ Globally, the elimination net is widening, with more countries moving towards zero indigenous cases: in 2018, 49 countries reported fewer than 10 000 such cases, up from 46 countries in 2017 and 40 countries in 2010. The number of countries with fewer than 100 indigenous cases – a strong indicator that elimination is within reach – increased from 17 countries in 2010, to 25 countries in 2017 and 27 countries in 2018. ■ Paraguay and Uzbekistan were awarded WHO certification of elimination in 2018, with Algeria and Argentina achieving certification in early 2019. In 2018, China, El Salvador, Iran, Malaysia and Timor-Leste reported zero indigenous cases. ■ One of the key GTS milestones for 2020 is elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries that were malaria endemic in 2015. At the current rate of progress, it is likely that this milestone will be reached. ■ In 2016, WHO identified 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by the year 2020. WHO is working with the governments in these countries – known as “E-2020 countries” – to support their elimination acceleration goals. ■ Although 10 E-2020 countries remain on track to achieve their elimination goals, Comoros and Costa Rica reported increases in indigenous malaria cases in 2018 compared with 2017. ■ In the six countries of the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) – Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province), Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam – the reported number of malaria cases fell by 76% between 2010 and 2018, and malaria deaths fell by 95% over the same period. In 2018, Cambodia reported no malaria related deaths for the first time in the country’s history. xiv

INVESTMENTS IN MALARIA PROGRAMMES AND RESEARCH ■ In 2018, an estimated US$ 2.7 billion was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts globally by governments of malaria endemic countries and international partners – a reduction from the US$ 3.2 billion that was invested in 2017. The amount invested in 2018 fell short of the US$ 5.0 billion estimated to be required globally to stay on track towards the GTS milestones. ■ Nearly three quarters of investments in 2018 were spent in the WHO African Region, followed by the WHO Region of the Americas (7%), the WHO South-East Asia Region (6%), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the WHO Western Pacific Region (5% each). ■ In 2018, 47% of total funding for malaria was invested in low-income countries, 43% in lower- middle-income countries and 11% in upper-middle-income countries. International funding represented the major source of funding in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, at 85% and 61%, respectively. Domestic funding has remained stable since 2010. ■ Of the US$ 2.7 billion invested in 2018, US$ 1.8 billion came from international funders. Governments of malaria endemic countries contributed 30% of total funding (US$ 900 million) in 2018, a figure unchanged from 2017. Two thirds of domestically sourced funds were invested in malaria control activities carried out by national malaria programmes (NMPs), with the remaining share estimated as the cost of patient care. ■ As in previous years, the United States of America (USA) was the largest international source of malaria financing, providing US$ 1.0 billion (37%) in 2018. Country members of the Development Assistance Committee together accounted for US$ 300 million (11%). The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland contributed around US$ 200 million (7%). ■ Of the US$ 2.7 billion invested in 2018, US$ 1.0 billion was channelled through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. ■ Although funding for malaria has remained relatively stable since 2010, the level of investment in 2018 is far from what is required to reach the first two milestones of the GTS; that is, a reduction of at least 40% in malaria case incidence and mortality rates globally by 2020, compared with 2015 levels. ■ US$ 663 million was invested in basic research and product development for malaria in 2018, an increase of US$ 18 million compared with 2017. ■ Funding for drug research and development (R&D) increased to the highest level ever recorded, from US$ 228 million in 2017 to US$ 252 million in 2018. This increase was a result of private sector industry investment in several Phase II trials of new chemical entities with the potential for single- exposure radical cure. Deliveries of malaria commodities Insecticide-treated mosquito nets ■ Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 578 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), mainly LLINs, were reported by manufacturers as having been delivered globally, with 50% going to Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. ■ In 2018 about 197 million ITNs were delivered by manufacturers, of which more than 87% were delivered to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. ■ Globally, 80% of ITNs were distributed through mass distribution campaigns, 10% in antenatal care facilities and 6% as part of immunization programmes. Rapid diagnostic tests ■ An estimated 412 million RDTs were sold globally in 2018. ■ In 2018, 259 million RDTs were distributed by NMPs. Most RDTs (64%) were tests that detected P. falciparum only and were supplied to sub-Saharan Africa. xv 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Artemisinin-based combination therapy ■ An estimated 3 billion treatment courses of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) were procured by countries over the period 2010–2018. An estimated 63% of these procurements were reported to have been made for the public sector. ■ In 2018, 214 million ACT treatment courses were delivered by NMPs, of which 98% were in the WHO African Region. PREVENTING MALARIA Vector control ■ Half of people at risk of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa are sleeping under an ITN; in 2018, 50% of the population were protected by this intervention, an increase from 29% in 2010. Furthermore, the percentage of the population with access to an ITN increased from 33% in 2010 to 57% in 2018. However, coverage has improved only marginally since 2015 and has been at a standstill since 2016. ■ Households with at least one ITN for every two people increased to 72% in 2018, from 47% in 2010. However, this figure represents only a modest increase over the past 3 years, and remains far from the target of universal coverage. ■ Fewer people at risk of malaria are being protected by indoor residual spraying (IRS), a prevention method that involves spraying the inside walls of dwellings with insecticides. Globally, IRS protection declined from a peak of 5% in 2010 to 2% in 2018, with declining trends seen across all WHO regions apart from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. ■ Although IRS coverage dropped from 180 million people at risk protected globally in 2010 to 93 million in 2018, the 2018 figure was a decrease of 13 million compared with 2017. ■ The declines in IRS coverage may be due to the switch from pyrethroids to more expensive insecticides in response to increasing pyrethroid resistance, or changes in operational strategies (e.g. at-risk populations decreasing in countries aiming for elimination of malaria). Preventive therapies ■ To protect women in areas of moderate and high malaria transmission in Africa, WHO recommends IPTp with the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Among 36 African countries that reported on IPTp coverage levels in 2018, an estimated 31% of eligible pregnant women received the recommended three or more doses of IPTp, compared with 22% in 2017 and 2% in 2010, indicating considerable improvements in country uptake. ■ About 18% of women who use antenatal care services at least once do not receive any IPTp, representing a missed opportunity that, if harnessed, could considerably and rapidly improve IPTp coverage. ■ In 2018, 19 million children in 12 countries in Africa’s Sahel subregion were protected through SMC programmes. All targeted children received treatment in Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Mali. However, about 12 million children who could have benefited from this intervention were not covered, mainly due to a lack of funding. xvi

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND TREATMENT Accessing care ■ Prompt diagnosis and treatment is the most effective way to prevent a mild case of malaria from developing into severe disease and death. Based on national household surveys completed in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 2015 and 2018, a median of 42% (interquartile range [IQR]: 34–49%) of children with a fever (febrile) were taken to a trained medical provider for care in the public sector compared with 10% (IQR: 8–22%) in the formal private sector and 3% (IQR: 2–7%) in the informal private sector. ■ A high proportion of febrile children did not receive any medical attention (median: 36%, IQR: 28–45%). Poor access to health care providers or lack of awareness of malaria symptoms among caregivers are among the contributing factors. Diagnosing malaria ■ The percentage of patients suspected of having malaria who are seen in public health facilities and tested with either an RDT or microscopy, rose from 38% in 2010 to 85% in 2018. ■ In 71% of moderate to high transmission countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of suspected cases tested with any parasitological test was greater than 80% in 2018. ■ According to 19 nationally representative household surveys conducted between 2015 and 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa, the median percentage of febrile children brought for care who received a finger or heel stick (suggesting that a malaria diagnostic test may have been performed) was greater in the public sector (median: 66%, IQR: 49–75%) than in the formal private sector (median: 40%, IQR: 16–46%) or the informal private sector (median: 9%, IQR: 5–22%). ■ According to 61 surveys conducted in 29 sub-Saharan African countries between 2010 and 2018, the percentage of children with a fever that received a diagnostic test before antimalarial treatment in the public health sector increased from a median of 48% (IQR: 30–62%) in 2010–2013 to a median of 76% (IQR: 60–86%) in 2015–2018. Treating malaria ■ Based on 20 household surveys conducted in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015–2018, the median percentage of febrile children who were treated with any antimalarial drug was higher in the public sector (median: 48%, IQR: 30–69%) than in the formal private sector (median: 40%, IQR: 21–51%) or the informal private sector (median: 18%, IQR: 10–29%). ■ Data from 20 national surveys conducted in sub-Saharan Africa show that for the period 2015– 2018, an estimated 47% (IQR: 29–69%) of febrile children brought for treatment for malaria in the public health sector received antimalarial drugs, compared with 59% (IQR: 53–84%) among those visiting a community health worker and 49% (IQR: 19–55%) in the formal medical private sector. ■ Based on 19 surveys, antimalarial treatments among febrile children who received antimalarial medicine were slightly more likely to be ACTs if treatment was sought in the public sector (median: 80%, IQR: 45–94%) than in the formal private sector (median: 77%, IQR: 43–87%) or the informal private sector (median: 60%, IQR: 40–84%). ■ To bridge the treatment gap among children, WHO recommends the uptake of integrated community case management (iCCM). This approach promotes integrated management of common life-threatening conditions in children – malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea – at health facility and community levels. In 2018, 30 countries were implementing iCCM at different levels, with only a few implementing nationally. xvii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

MALARIA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS ■ Pillar 3 of the GTS is to transform malaria surveillance into a core intervention. To understand whether malaria surveillance systems are fit for purpose, WHO recommends the regular monitoring and evaluation of surveillance systems. ■ The Global Malaria Programme (GMP), in collaboration with the University of Oslo, has developed standardized malaria modules in District Health Information Software2 (DHIS2) for aggregate and case-based collection of routine data with associated data elements, dashboards of key epidemiological and data quality indicators, reports and a curriculum for facility-level data analysis to facilitate data analysis and interpretation. ■ As of October 2019, 23 countries have installed the WHO aggregate malaria module and another six installations are planned over the next year. Five countries have already developed and integrated their own malaria module into DHIS2. ■ WHO has been working in coordination with national health management information systems (HMIS) departments of ministries of health, in particular the HBHI countries, to establish structured dynamic databases known as data repositories. The GMP has developed an easily adaptable repository structure in DHIS2, with guidance on relevant data elements and indicators, their definitions and computation to cover key thematic areas. So far, work to develop these databases has started in Gambia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. ■ WHO also encourages countries to implement surveillance system assessments. An example of such an assessment and its role in improving surveillance systems is illustrated through a case study of Mozambique. RESPONDING TO BIOLOGICAL THREATS TO THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA Pfhrp2/3 gene deletions ■ Deletions in the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 (pfhrp2/3) genes of the parasite renders parasites undetectable by RDTs based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2). The prevalence of dual pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 among symptomatic patients reached as high as 80% in Eritrea and Peru. ■ WHO has recommended that countries with reports of pfhrp2/3 deletions or neighbouring countries should conduct representative baseline surveys among suspected malaria cases to determine whether the prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions causing false negative RDT results has reached a threshold for RDT change (>5% pfhrp2 deletions causing false negative RDT results). ■ WHO is tracking published reports of pfhrp2/3 deletions using the Malaria Threat Map mapping tool. To date, 28 countries have reported pfhrp2 deletions. Drug resistance ■ PfKelch13 mutations have been identified as molecular markers of partial artemisinin resistance. PfKelch13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance are widespread in the GMS, and have also been detected at a significant prevalence (over 5%) in Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda. In the case of Rwanda, the presence of PfKelch13 mutations does not affect efficacy of first-line treatment. ■ In the WHO Western Pacific Region, artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam through several studies conducted between 2001 xviii

and 2018. Treatment efficacy for P. vivax remains high across all countries where treatment failure rates are below 10%. ■ In the WHO African Region the efficacy rates of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate- amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) for P. falciparum were more than 98%, and efficacy has remained high over time. ■ Treatment efficacy with first-line treatment remains high for P. falciparum and P. vivax in the WHO Region of the Americas. ■ In the WHO South-East Asia Region, the presence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance has been reported in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Thailand. With the exception of Myanmar, failure rates of P. falciparum to first-line ACTs were found to be above 10% and were as high as 93% in Thailand. For P. vivax most countries continue to demonstrate high efficacy of chloroquine (CQ), except for Myanmar and Timor-Leste. ■ In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, high failure rates of treatment with artesunate- sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS-SP) for P. falciparum in Somalia and Sudan led to a change in first-line treatment policy to AL. For P. vivax there is high treatment efficacy with AL and CQ in all countries where a therapeutic efficacy study (TES) has been conducted. Insecticide resistance ■ From 2010 through 2018, some 81 countries reported data on insecticide resistance monitoring to WHO. ■ Of the 81 malaria endemic countries that provided data for 2010–2018, resistance to at least one of the four insecticide classes in one malaria vector from one collection site was detected in 73 countries, an increase of five countries compared with the previous reporting period 2010–2017. In 26 countries, resistance was reported to all main insecticide classes. ■ Resistance to pyrethroids – the only insecticide class currently used in ITNs – is widespread and was detected in at least one malaria vector in more than two thirds of the sites tested, and was highest in the WHO African Region and in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. ■ Resistance to organochlorines was detected for at least one malaria vector in almost two thirds of the sites. Resistance to carbamates and organophosphates was less prevalent and was detected in 31% and 26% of the tested sites, respectively. Prevalence was highest for carbamates in the WHO South-East Asia Region and for organophosphates in the WHO South-East Asia Region and in the WHO Western Pacific Region. ■ All the standard insecticide resistance data reported to WHO are included in the WHO Global Insecticide Resistance database, and are available for exploration via the Malaria Threats Map. This online tool was extended in 2019 to cover invasive mosquito species, and currently shows the geographical extent of reports on the detection of Anopheles stephensi. ■ To guide resistance management, countries should develop and implement a national plan for insecticide-resistance monitoring and management, drawing on the WHO Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vector. In 2018, a total of 45 countries reported having completed plans for resistance monitoring and management and 36 were currently in the process of developing them. ■ NMPs and their partners should consider the deployment of pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide nets in geographical areas where the main malaria vectors meet the criteria recommended by WHO in 2017, rather than being based on whether the whole country meets the criteria. xix 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Avant-propos Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Directeur général de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) N’oublier personne sur la voie d’un monde sans paludisme Le fléau du paludisme continue de toucher plus lourdement les femmes enceintes et les enfants en Afrique. Le Rapport sur le paludisme dans le monde 2019 comporte donc une section spéciale sur le poids de cette maladie et ses conséquences sur ces deux groupes les plus à risque. Le message qu’il délivre est très clair : nous devons tous faire davantage pour protéger les plus vulnérables contre une maladie responsable de plus de 400 000 décès chaque année. Le paludisme pendant la grossesse nuit à la santé de la mère et l’expose à un risque accru de décès. Il a un impact sur la santé du fœtus, entraînant prématurité et insuffisance pondérale à la naissance qui sont les principales causes de mortalité néonatale et infantile. L’an passé, environ 11 millions de femmes enceintes en Afrique subsaharienne ont présenté une infection palustre et, par conséquent, près de 900 000 enfants un faible poids à la naissance. Pour protéger les femmes enceintes en Afrique, l’OMS recommande l’utilisation de moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide (MII) et de médicaments antipaludiques préventifs. Ce rapport fait état de progrès sur les deux fronts. Pourtant, près de 40 % des femmes enceintes n’ont pas dormi sous MII en 2018 et les deux tiers n’ont pas reçu le minimum de trois doses de traitement préventif comme il est recommandé. En ce qui concerne les enfants, les efforts déployés pour améliorer l’accès aux médicaments antipaludiques préventifs portent leurs fruits. En Afrique, dans la sous-région du Sahel, l’OMS recommande la chimioprévention du paludisme saisonnier durant la période de pic de transmission. Plus de 60 % des enfants vivant dans des zones éligibles à ce traitement préventif en ont bénéficié en 2018. La Sierra Leone peut être citée en exemple ; en effet, elle est devenue le premier pays d’Afrique à déployer le traitement préventif intermittent chez les nourrissons, une autre approche recommandée par l’OMS pour protéger les enfants en bas âge dans les zones touchées par le paludisme. Chez les enfants présentant des signes de fièvre, l’accès aux soins reste néanmoins trop faible. En Afrique subsaharienne, les enquêtes nationales indiquent que près de 40 % des enfants ayant eu de la fièvre n’ont pas été orientés vers un prestataire médical formé. Au moins 10 pays participant à l’« Initiative E-2020 » de l’OMS sont en passe d’atteindre l’objectif d’élimination du paludisme d’ici à 2020 défini dans notre stratégie mondiale de lutte contre le paludisme. En 2015, la maladie était endémique dans tous ces pays ; aujourd’hui, soit ils n’enregistrent aucun cas de paludisme indigène, soit ils sont tout proches de l’objectif. Toutefois, les progrès réalisés au niveau mondial en termes de baisse de l’incidence du paludisme ont ralenti ces dernières années. Plus préoccupant encore, le paludisme progresse dans quelques pays d’Afrique où il pèse déjà lourdement. xx

Il est probable que des objectifs essentiels de notre stratégie mondiale de lutte contre le paludisme ne seront pas atteints. En 2018, l’OMS et le Partenariat RBM pour en finir avec le paludisme ont lancé « High burden to high impact » (« D’une charge élevée à un fort impact »), une nouvelle approche visant à prévenir la maladie et à sauver des vies dans les pays les plus durement touchés par le paludisme. Se substituant à une stratégie « universelle », cette approche encourage l’utilisation des outils les plus efficaces de façon plus ciblée. Je suis ravi de constater que deux pays, l’Inde et l’Ouganda, ont rapporté une baisse substantielle du nombre de cas de paludisme en 2018 par rapport à l’année précédente. En septembre, j’ai publié un « Malaria Challenge », préconisant d’investir davantage dans la recherche et le développement d’outils, de technologies et d’approches de transformation innovants afin d’accélérer les progrès réalisés pour vaincre cette maladie. Grâce à un programme pilote coordonné par l’OMS, le Ghana, le Kenya et le Malawi ont récemment introduit dans certaines régions le premier vaccin antipaludique au monde. Les données et les expériences tirées de ce programme éclaireront les décisions politiques sur une utilisation éventuellement plus large du vaccin en Afrique. Grâce au soutien du Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et le paludisme et d’Unitaid, d’autres outils prometteurs sont en phase de test, notamment de nouveaux types de moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide, ainsi que des outils ciblant les moustiques exophages. Pour concrétiser notre vision commune d’un monde sans paludisme, nous allons également devoir renforcer notre action dans d’autres domaines essentiels. Nous avons besoin de services de santé abordables et axés sur les populations. Nous avons également besoin de systèmes de surveillance et de riposte qui soient fiables et précis. Enfin, nous devons définir des stratégies parfaitement adaptées aux conditions locales de transmission du paludisme. Augmenter le financement de la lutte contre le paludisme est également indispensable. En 2018, le financement total du contrôle et de l’élimination du paludisme a atteint US$ 2,7 milliards, bien en deçà de l’objectif de US$ 5 milliards défini dans le cadre de notre stratégie mondiale. Grâce à un financement solide et résolu, à un véritable leadership politique et à une couverture de santé universelle, nous pourrons venir à bout de cette maladie une fois pour toutes. xxi 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Le rapport de cette année en un clin d’œil POIDS DU PALUDISME AU NIVEAU MONDIAL ET RÉGIONAL : ÉVOLUTION DU NOMBRE DE CAS ET DE DÉCÈS Cas de paludisme ■ Au niveau mondial, le nombre de cas de paludisme est estimé à 228 millions en 2018 (intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % : 206-258 millions), contre 251 millions en 2010 (IC de 95 % : 231-278 millions) et 231 millions en 2017 (IC de 95 % : 211-259 millions). ■ La plupart des cas (213 millions ou 93 %) ont été enregistrés en 2018 dans la région Afrique de l’OMS, loin devant la région Asie du Sud-Est (3,4 %) et la région Méditerranée orientale (2,1 %). ■ Dix-neuf pays d’Afrique subsaharienne1 et l’Inde ont concentré quasiment 85 % du nombre total de cas de paludisme dans le monde. Six pays, à eux seuls, ont enregistré plus de la moitié des cas : le Nigéria (25 %), la République démocratique du Congo (12 %), l’Ouganda (5 %), ainsi que la Côte d’Ivoire, le Mozambique et le Niger (4 % chacun). ■ Au niveau mondial, l’incidence du paludisme a reculé entre 2010 et 2018, passant de 71 cas pour 1 000 habitants exposés au risque de paludisme à 57 pour 1 000. Néanmoins, cette baisse a considérablement ralenti entre 2014 et 2018, l’incidence ayant diminué à 57 pour 1 000 en 2014 pour rester à un niveau similaire jusqu’en 2018. ■ Dans la région Asie du Sud-Est de l’OMS, l’incidence du paludisme continue à baisser, de 17 cas pour 1 000 habitants exposés au risque de paludisme en 2010 à 5 pour 1 000 en 2018 (soit une baisse de 70 %). De même, l’incidence du paludisme a diminué dans la région Afrique de l’OMS, avec 294 cas pour 1 000 en 2010 contre 229 en 2018 (-22 %). Toutes les autres régions de l’OMS ont enregistré des progrès très modestes, voire une hausse de l’incidence. Dans la région Amériques de l’OMS, l’incidence du paludisme a augmenté, principalement à cause d’une transmission accrue au Venezuela (République bolivarienne du). ■ Seuls 31 pays dans lesquels le paludisme est encore endémique ont réduit l’incidence du paludisme de manière significative entre 2015 et 2018 et étaient donc en passe d’atteindre une baisse de l’incidence égale à au moins 40 % d’ici 2020. À moins d’un changement rapide, les objectifs de morbidité définis pour 2025 et 2030 dans la Stratégie technique de lutte contre le paludisme 2016-2030 ([le] GTS) ne seront pas atteints. ■ P. falciparum est le parasite du paludisme le plus prévalent dans la région Afrique de l’OMS ; il est en effet à l’origine de 99,7 % des cas de paludisme estimés en 2018, tout comme dans les régions Asie du Sud-Est (50 %), Méditerranée orientale (71 %) et Pacifique occidental (65 %). ■ Au niveau mondial, 53 % des cas de paludisme à P. vivax sont enregistrés dans la région Asie du Sud-Est de l’OMS, avec une majorité des cas en Inde (47 %). P. vivax prédomine dans la région Amériques de l’OMS, représentant 75 % des cas de paludisme. Mortalité associée ■ Au niveau mondial, le nombre de décès dus au paludisme a été estimé à 405 000 en 2018, contre 416 000 en 2017 et 585 000 en 2010. ■ Les enfants de moins de 5 ans sont les plus vulnérables face au paludisme. En 2018, ils ont représenté 67 % (272 000) des décès associés au paludisme dans le monde. ■ À elle seule, la région Afrique de l’OMS a enregistré 94 % des décès liés au paludisme dans le monde en 2018. Pourtant, elle a aussi représenté 85 % des 180 000 décès en moins dus à la maladie par rapport à 2010. 1 La liste des pays d’Afrique subsaharienne est disponible à l’adresse https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49 ; pour toutes les ana- lyses présentées dans ce rapport et liées aux pays d’endémie du paludisme en Afrique subsaharienne, le Soudan est également inclus. xxii

■ Près de 85 % des décès dus au paludisme dans le monde en 2018 ont été concentrés dans 20 pays de la région Afrique de l’OMS et en Inde. Le Nigéria a représenté à lui seul près de 24 % de ces décès, suivi par la République démocratique du Congo (11 %), la République-Unie de Tanzanie (5 %), ainsi que l’Angola, le Mozambique et le Niger (4 % chacun). ■ Par rapport à 2010, la mortalité liée au paludisme n’a diminué en 2018 que dans les régions Afrique et Asie du Sud-Est de l’OMS. La baisse la plus prononcée du nombre de décès dus au paludisme, en valeur absolue, a été observée dans la région Afrique de l’OMS, qui est passée de 533 000 décès en 2010 à 380 000 en 2018. Malgré ces progrès, la baisse de la mortalité liée au paludisme a ralenti depuis 2016. CONSÉQUENCES DU PALUDISME SUR LA SANTÉ MATERNELLE ET INFANTILE ■ En 2018, près de 11 millions de femmes enceintes vivant dans des zones de transmission modérée à élevée en Afrique subsaharienne auraient été exposées à une infection palustre. ■ Cette même année, la prévalence de l’exposition à l’infection palustre durant la grossesse a été plus forte dans les sous-régions Afrique de l’Ouest et Afrique centrale (chacune avec 35 %), suivies par la sous-région Afrique de l’Est et Afrique australe (20 %). Près de 39 % de cette prévalence a été concentrée en République démocratique du Congo et au Nigéria. ■ Les 11 millions de femmes enceintes exposées à une infection palustre en 2018 ont donné naissance à quelque 872 000 enfants présentant un faible poids à la naissance (soit 16 % de tous les enfants avec un faible poids à la naissance dans ces pays). L’Afrique de l’Ouest a enregistré la plus forte prévalence d’insuffisance pondérale (liée au paludisme pendant la grossesse) chez le nouveau-né. ■ Entre 2015 et 2018, dans 21 pays de la région Afrique de l’OMS où la transmission du paludisme est modérée à élevée, la prévalence de l’anémie chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans avec un résultat positif à un test de diagnostic rapide (TDR) était deux fois plus élevée que chez les enfants avec un résultat de TDR négatif. Parmi les enfants avec un résultat de test positif, 9 % souffraient d’anémie grave et 54 % d’anémie modérée. À titre de comparaison, 1 % seulement des enfants non infectés par le paludisme souffraient d’anémie grave et 31 % d’anémie modérée. ■ Les pays où l’anémie grave chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans présentant un résultat positif à un test de dépistage du paludisme était la plus prévalente étaient les suivants : le Sénégal (26 %), le Mali (16 %), la Guinée (14 %) et le Mozambique (12 %). Dans la plupart des autres pays, l’anémie grave atteignait entre 5 % et 10 %. ■ Selon les estimations, près de 24 millions d’enfants d’Afrique subsaharienne ont souffert d’infections palustres à P. falciparum en 2018, avec un risque d’anémie grave pour 1,8 million d’entre eux. APPROCHE « HIGH BURDEN TO HIGH IMPACT » (D’UNE CHARGE ÉLEVÉE À UN FORT IMPACT) ■ Les 11 pays où le paludisme sévit le plus (pays de l’approche HBHI) ont enregistré près de 155 millions de cas en 2018, contre 177 millions en 2010. La République démocratique du Congo et le Nigéria ont cumulé 84 millions de ces cas (54 %). ■ Parmi les 10 pays africains de l’approche HBHI, le Ghana et le Nigéria ont rapporté les plus fortes augmentations, en valeur absolue, du nombre de cas en 2018 par rapport à 2017. En 2018, le poids du paludisme dans les autres pays est resté à un niveau similaire à celui de 2017, à l’exception de l’Ouganda et de l’Inde, qui ont rapporté respectivement 1,5 million et 2,6 millions de cas en moins. ■ Les décès dus au paludisme ont diminué, passant de près de 400 000 en 2010 à environ 260 000 en 2018. La plus forte baisse a été enregistrée au Nigéria, avec 153 000 décès en 2010 et 95 000 décès en 2018. ■ En 2018, dans les 11 pays de l’approche HBHI, au moins 40 % de la population à risque avait dormi sous moustiquaire imprégnée d’insecticide longue durée (MILD). Le pourcentage le plus élevé a été enregistré en Ouganda (80 %), et le plus faible au Nigéria (40 %). xxiii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

■ Selon les estimations, c’est uniquement au Burkina Faso et en République-Unie de Tanzanie que plus de 50 % des femmes enceintes ont reçu trois doses de traitement préventif intermittent pendant la grossesse (TPIp3) en 2018. Au Cameroun, au Nigéria et en Ouganda, le taux de couverture a atteint environ 30 %, voire moins. ■ Six pays de la sous-région sahélienne ont mis en œuvre la chimioprévention du paludisme saisonnier (CPS) en 2018. En moyenne, 17 millions d’enfants sur les 26 millions ciblés ont été traités par cycle de CPS. ■ Le pourcentage des enfants de moins de 5 ans ayant de la fièvre et sollicitant des soins a varié entre 58 % au Mali et 82 % en Ouganda. En République démocratique du Congo et au Mali, plus de 40 % des enfants n’ont sollicité aucun soin. Tout aussi préoccupant, le taux de dépistage du paludisme a été très faible chez les enfants sollicitant des soins, avec 30 % ou moins d’enfants testés au Cameroun, en République démocratique du Congo et au Nigéria. ■ Dans tous les pays de l’approche HBHI à l’exception de l’Inde, les investissements nationaux directs restent très peu élevés par rapport au financement international. ÉLIMINATION DU PALUDISME ET PRÉVENTION DE SA RÉAPPARITION ■ Au niveau mondial, l’élimination du paludisme progresse. En effet, de plus en plus de pays tendent vers un nombre de cas de paludisme indigène égal à zéro. En 2018, 49 pays ont rapporté moins de 10 000 cas de paludisme indigène, alors qu’ils n’étaient que 46 en 2017 et 40 en 2010. Le nombre de pays comptant moins de 100 cas de paludisme indigène, un bon indicateur que l’élimination de la maladie est proche, est passé de 17 en 2010 à 25 en 2017, puis à 27 en 2018. ■ Le Paraguay et l’Ouzbékistan ont été certifiés exempts de paludisme par l’OMS en 2018, alors que l’Algérie et l’Argentine ont obtenu cette certification début 2019. En 2018, la Chine, El Salvador, l’Iran, la Malaisie et le Timor-Leste ont rapporté zéro cas de paludisme indigène. ■ Éliminer le paludisme dans au moins 10 pays où il était encore endémique en 2010 est l’un des principaux objectifs intermédiaires du GTS pour 2020. Compte tenu du rythme de progression actuel, il est probable que cet objectif sera atteint. ■ En 2016, l’OMS a identifié 21 pays ayant le potentiel pour éliminer le paludisme d’ici 2020. L’OMS travaille avec les gouvernements de ces pays appelés « E-2020 » pour les aider à atteindre leurs objectifs d’élimination. ■ Même si 10 de ces pays restent en bonne voie pour atteindre leurs objectifs, les Comores et le Costa Rica ont rapporté une augmentation des cas de paludisme indigène en 2018 par rapport à 2017. ■ En revanche, dans les six pays de la sous-région du Grand Mékong (Cambodge, Chine [province du Yunnan], République démocratique populaire lao, Myanmar, Thaïlande et Viet Nam), le nombre de cas de paludisme rapportés a diminué de 76 % entre 2010 et 2018, alors que le nombre de décès dus au paludisme a chuté de 95 % sur la même période. En 2018, le Cambodge n’a rapporté aucun décès dû au paludisme pour la première fois de son histoire. INVESTISSEMENTS DANS LES PROGRAMMES ET LA RECHERCHE ANTIPALUDIQUES ■ En 2018, US$ 2,7 milliards ont été investis au total par les gouvernements des pays d’endémie et les partenaires internationaux pour le contrôle et l’élimination du paludisme, soit une baisse par rapport aux US$ 3,2 milliards investis en 2017. Les investissements de 2018 sont bien inférieurs aux xxiv

US$ 5 milliards estimés nécessaires à l’échelle mondiale pour rester sur la voie des objectifs du GTS. ■ Près des trois quarts des investissements réalisés en 2018 ont été dirigés vers la région Afrique de l’OMS, suivie par les régions Amériques (7 %), Asie du Sud-Est (6 %), Méditerranée orientale et Pacifique occidental (5 % chacune). ■ En 2018, 47 % du financement total a été investi dans des pays à faible revenu, 43 % dans des pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche inférieure et 11 % dans des pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure. Les fonds internationaux ont représenté la principale source de financement dans les pays à faible revenu et à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche inférieure (respectivement 85 % et 61 %). Les financements nationaux stagnent depuis 2010. ■ Sur les US$ 2,7 milliards investis en 2018, US$ 1,8 milliard provenaient de bailleurs de fonds internationaux. En 2018, les gouvernements des pays d’endémie ont contribué à hauteur de 30 % du financement total (US$ 900 millions), un chiffre inchangé par rapport à 2017. Deux tiers des financements nationaux ont été investis dans des activités de contrôle menées par les programmes nationaux de lutte contre le paludisme (PNLP), le tiers restant étant estimé correspondre aux coûts des soins dispensés aux patients. ■ Comme les années précédentes, les États-Unis ont été le premier bailleur de fonds international pour les programmes de lutte contre le paludisme, avec US$ 1 milliard en 2018 (37 % du total). Les pays membres du Comité d’aide au développement ont investi au total US$ 300 millions (11 %). Le Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d’Irlande du Nord a contribué à hauteur d’environ US$ 200 millions (7 %). ■ Sur les US$ 2,7 milliards investis en 2018, US$ 1 milliard ont transité par le Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et le paludisme. ■ Même si le financement de la lutte contre le paludisme est relativement stable depuis 2010, les investissements consentis en 2018 sont loin d’atteindre le niveau requis pour réaliser les deux premiers objectifs intermédiaires du GTS, à savoir réduire d’au moins 40 % l’incidence du paludisme et la mortalité associée au plan mondial par rapport à 2015. ■ Au total, US$ 663 millions ont été investis en 2018 dans la recherche fondamentale et le développement de produits contre le paludisme, soit une hausse de US$ 18 millions par rapport à 2017. ■ Les fonds dédiés à la recherche et au développement (R&D) de médicaments ont atteint un niveau record, passant de US$ 228 millions en 2017 à US$ 252 millions en 2018. Cette augmentation est due aux investissements du secteur industriel privé dans plusieurs essais de phase II sur de nouveaux composants chimiques offrant le potentiel d’une guérison radicale en une prise unique. Livraison de produits antipaludiques Moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide ■ Les fabricants de moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide (MII) ont indiqué en avoir livré 578 millions dans le monde entre 2016 et 2018, principalement des MILD, dont 50 % en Côte d’Ivoire, en République démocratique du Congo, en Éthiopie, au Ghana, en Inde, au Nigéria, en Ouganda et en République-Unie de Tanzanie. ■ En 2018, ces fabricants ont livré environ 197 millions de MII, dont plus de 87 % en Afrique subsaharienne. ■ Au niveau mondial, 80 % des MII ont été distribuées gratuitement par le biais de campagnes de distribution de masse, 10 % via des établissements de soins prénataux et 6 % dans le cadre de programmes de vaccination. Tests de diagnostic rapide ■ En 2018, 412 millions de TDR ont été vendus dans le monde. ■ En 2018, 259 millions de TDR ont été distribués par les PNLP. La plupart de ces TDR (64 %) étaient des tests livrés en Afrique subsaharienne et pouvant uniquement détecter le parasite P. falciparum. xxv 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Combinaisons thérapeutiques à base d’artémisinine ■ Entre 2010 et 2018, les pays ont acheté 3 milliards de traitements par combinaison thérapeutique à base d’artémisinine (ACT). Au total, 63 % de ces achats auraient été effectués pour le secteur public de la santé. ■ En 2018, 214 millions de traitements par ACT ont été distribués par les PNLP, dont 98 % dans la région Afrique de l’OMS. PRÉVENTION DU PALUDISME Lutte antivectorielle ■ En Afrique subsaharienne, la moitié de la population à risque dort sous MII : en 2018, 50 % de la population a donc été protégée par cette intervention, contre 29 % en 2010. Par ailleurs, la part de la population ayant accès à une MII est passée de 33 % en 2010 à 57 % en 2018. Le taux de couverture n’a cependant que très peu augmenté depuis 2015 et il s’est même stabilisé depuis 2016. ■ Le pourcentage des ménages disposant d’au moins une MII pour deux membres du foyer est passé de 47 % en 2010 à 72 % en 2018. Ce pourcentage ne représente néanmoins qu’une augmentation très modeste au cours des trois dernières années et reste bien loin de l’objectif de couverture universelle. ■ La part de la population à risque protégée par pulvérisation intradomiciliaire d’insecticides à effet rémanent (PID), une mesure préventive qui consiste à pulvériser d’insecticides les murs intérieurs des habitations, a diminué. Au niveau mondial, le taux de couverture de cette intervention a diminué, passant d’un pic de 5 % en 2010 à 2 % en 2018, avec des tendances à la baisse dans toutes les régions de l’OMS, hormis la région Méditerranée orientale. ■ Même si la population à risque couverte par cette intervention a chuté de 180 millions en 2010 à 93 millions en 2018, elle est pour 2018 inférieure de 13 millions au niveau de 2017. ■ Ce recul de la couverture en PID est sans doute lié au passage des pyréthoïdes à des insecticides plus onéreux en réponse à la résistance aux pyréthoïdes ou à des changements de stratégies opérationnelles (baisse de la population à risque dans les pays en voie d’élimination du paludisme). Traitements préventifs ■ En Afrique, pour protéger les femmes vivant dans des zones de transmission modérée à élevée, l’OMS recommande le traitement préventif intermittent pendant la grossesse (TPIp) par sulfadoxine-pyriméthamine (SP). Sur 36 pays africains ayant communiqué des données de couverture en TPIp en 2018, 31 % des femmes enceintes éligibles ont reçu au moins trois doses de TPIp (comme recommandé par l’OMS), contre 22 % en 2017 et 2 % en 2010, ce qui traduit des progrès considérables en termes de mise en œuvre au niveau national. ■ Toutefois, environ 18 % des femmes s’étant présentées au moins une fois dans un établissement de soins prénataux n’ont reçu aucune dose de TPIp. Si elles avaient été exploitées, ces opportunités de traitement auraient permis d’améliorer considérablement et rapidement la couverture en TPIp. ■ En 2018, 19 millions d’enfants vivant dans 12 pays d’Afrique sahélienne ont été protégés par des programmes de CPS. Tous les enfants ciblés ont reçu un traitement au Cameroun, en Guinée, en Guinée-Bissau et au Mali. Cependant, quelque 12 millions d’enfants qui auraient pu bénéficier de cette intervention n’ont pas été couverts, principalement à cause d’un manque de financements. xxvi

DIAGNOSTIC ET TRAITEMENT Accès aux soins ■ Un diagnostic précoce et un traitement rapide sont les moyens les plus efficaces de prévenir l’aggravation des cas de paludisme et les décès associés. D’après les enquêtes nationales réalisées dans 20 pays d’Afrique subsaharienne entre 2015 et 2018, une médiane de 42 % (écart interquartile [ÉI] : 34 %-49 %) des enfants ayant eu de la fièvre ont sollicité des soins auprès d’un prestataire formé dans un établissement public, contre une médiane de 10 % (ÉI : 8 %-22 %) dans un établissement privé formel et de 3 % (ÉI : 2 %-7 %) dans le secteur privé informel. ■ Une part importante des enfants n’ont pas reçu de soins médicaux (médiane de 36 %, ÉI : 28 %-45 %), ce qui s’explique en partie par un accès limité aux prestataires de santé ou un manque de connaissances de la part du personnel soignant. Diagnostic ■ Le pourcentage de patients suspectés de paludisme et soumis à un test de diagnostic par TDR ou microscopie dans un établissement public est passé de 38 % en 2010 à 85 % en 2018. ■ Dans 71 % des pays d’Afrique subsaharienne où la transmission est modérée à élevée, le pourcentage des cas suspectés de paludisme ayant été soumis à un test parasitologique a dépassé 80 % en 2018. ■ Sur les 19 enquêtes nationales réalisées auprès des ménages en Afrique subsaharienne entre 2015 et 2018, le pourcentage médian d’enfants fiévreux ayant subi un prélèvement sanguin au doigt ou au talon (laissant penser qu’un test de dépistage du paludisme a été réalisé) a été plus élevé dans le secteur public (médiane de 66 %, ÉI : 49 %-75 %) que dans les établissements privés formels (médiane de 40 %, ÉI : 16 %-46 %) ou dans le secteur privé informel (médiane de 9 %, ÉI : 5 %-22 %). ■ Sur 61 enquêtes menées dans 29 pays d’Afrique subsaharienne entre 2010 et 2018, le pourcentage des enfants fiévreux soumis à un test de diagnostic préalablement à tout traitement antipaludique dans un établissement public a augmenté, passant d’une médiane de 48 % (ÉI : 30 %-62 %) sur la période 2010-2013 à une médiane de 76 % (ÉI : 60 %-86 %) sur la période 2015-2018. Traitement ■ Sur 20 enquêtes nationales réalisées auprès des ménages en Afrique subsaharienne entre 2015 et 2018, le pourcentage médian des enfants fiévreux et ayant reçu un médicament antipaludique a été plus important dans le secteur public (médiane de 48 %, ÉI : 30 %-69 %) que dans le secteur privé formel (médiane de 40 %, ÉI : 21 %-51 %) ou le secteur privé informel (médiane de 18 %, ÉI : 10 %-29 %). ■ Entre 2015 et 2018, les données collectées à partir de 20 enquêtes nationales menées en Afrique subsaharienne montrent que 47 % (ÉI : 29 %-69 %) des enfants fiévreux ayant sollicité des soins dans le secteur public ont reçu un traitement antipaludique, contre 59 % (ÉI : 53 %-84 %) auprès d’un agent de santé communautaire et 49 % (ÉI : 19 %-55 %) dans un établissement privé formel. ■ D’après 19 enquêtes, la probabilité que les traitements antipaludiques donnés aux enfants fiévreux soient des ACT est légèrement plus élevée si le traitement est sollicité dans le secteur public (médiane de 80 %, ÉI : 45 %-94 %) que s’il l’est dans le secteur privé formel (médiane de 77 %, ÉI : 43 %-87 %) ou le secteur privé informel (médiane de 60 %, ÉI : 40 %-84 %). ■ Pour combler les écarts de traitement parmi les enfants, l’OMS recommande la prise en charge intégrée des cas dans la communauté (PEC-C). Cette approche favorise la gestion intégrée des causes de mortalité infantile, à savoir paludisme, pneumonie et diarrhée, au niveau des établissements de santé et de la communauté. En 2018, 30 pays avaient des politiques de PEC-C en place à différents niveaux, mais la mise en œuvre n’était effective au niveau national que dans quelques-uns. xxvii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

SYSTÈMES DE SURVEILLANCE DU PALUDISME ■ Faire de la surveillance du paludisme une intervention de base est le pilier 3 du GTS. Pour savoir si les systèmes de surveillance du paludisme en place sont adaptés, l’OMS recommande un suivi et une évaluation à intervalles réguliers de ces systèmes. ■ En collaboration avec l’Université d’Oslo, le Programme mondial de lutte antipaludique a développé des modules sur le paludisme uniformisés et intégrés à District Health Information Software2 (DHIS2). Ils permettent une collecte basée sur les cas et agrégée des données de routine, ainsi que la mise à disposition d’éléments associés, de tableaux de bord des principaux indicateurs épidémiologiques, d’indicateurs de qualité des données, de rapports et d’un programme d’analyse des données au niveau des établissements en vue de faciliter l’analyse et l’interprétation des données. ■ En date du mois d’octobre 2019, 23 pays avaient installé le module agrégé de l’OMS sur le paludisme, et six autres installations étaient planifiées pour 2020. Cinq pays ont déjà développé leur propre module sur le paludisme et l’ont intégré à DHIS2. ■ L’OMS travaille conjointement avec les départements chargés des systèmes de gestion de l’information sanitaire de différents ministères de la Santé, en particulier dans les pays de l’approche HBHI, pour établir des bases de données dynamiques structurées, appelées référentiels de données. Le Programme mondial de lutte antipaludique a ainsi développé une structure de référentiel facile à adapter dans DHIS2, ainsi que des directives sur des éléments de données et des indicateurs pertinents, leurs définitions et les calculs en vue de couvrir les domaines thématiques essentiels. À ce jour, le travail de développement de ces bases de données a commencé en Gambie, au Ghana, au Mozambique, au Nigéria, en Ouganda et en République-Unie de Tanzanie. ■ L’OMS encourage également les pays à mettre en œuvre des évaluations de leur système de surveillance. L’étude de cas du Mozambique est un parfait exemple de ce genre d’évaluation et de son rôle pour améliorer les systèmes de surveillance. RÉPONSES AUX MENACES BIOLOGIQUES EN MATIÈRE DE LUTTE CONTRE LE PALUDISME Suppression du gène pfhrp2/3 ■ La suppression des gènes pfhrp2 et pfhrp3 (pfhrp2/3) du parasite rendent ces derniers indétectables par les TDR basés sur la protéine riche en histidine 2 (HRP2). La prévalence des deux gènes pfhrp2 et pfhrp3 chez les patients symptomatiques a atteint jusqu’à 80 % en Érythrée et au Pérou. ■ L’OMS a recommandé aux pays rapportant des suppressions des gènes pfhrp2/3 ou à leurs pays voisins de mener des études de référence représentatives sur les cas suspectés de paludisme, afin de déterminer si la prévalence des suppressions pfhrp2/3 causant des résultats de TDR négatifs avait atteint un seuil qui nécessite un changement de TDR (suppressions du gène pfhrp2 > 5 % causant des faux résultats de TDR négatifs). ■ L’OMS effectue un suivi des rapports publiés sur les suppressions des gènes pfhrp2/3 par le biais de l’outil de cartographie Carte des menaces du paludisme. À ce jour, 28 pays ont rapporté des suppressions du gène pfhrp2. Résistance aux antipaludiques ■ Des mutations du gène PfKelch13 ont été identifiées en tant que marqueurs moléculaires de résistance partielle à l’artémisinine. Ces mutations PfKelch13 associées à la résistance à l’artémisinine sont répandues dans la sous-région du Grand Mékong et ont également été détectées avec une forte prévalence (plus de 5 %) au Guyana, en Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée et au Rwanda. Dans le cas du Rwanda, la présence de mutations PfKelch13 n’affecte pas l’efficacité des traitements de première intention. xxviii

■ Dans la région Pacifique occidental de l’OMS, diverses études menées entre 2001 et 2018 ont confirmé une résistance à l’artémisinine au Cambodge, en République démocratique populaire lao et au Viet Nam. L’efficacité du traitement contre les infections à P. vivax reste élevée dans tous les pays où le taux d’échec au traitement est inférieur à 10 %. ■ Dans la région Afrique de l’OMS, les taux d’efficacité des traitements à base d’artéméther-luméfantrine (AL), d’artésunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) et de dihydroartémisinine- pipéraquine (DHA-PPQ) contre les infections à P. falciparum ont été supérieurs à 98 %, et l’efficacité n’a jamais faibli au fil du temps. ■ L’efficacité des traitements de première intention reste élevée contre les infections à P. falciparum et à P. vivax dans la région Amériques de l’OMS. ■ Dans la région Asie du Sud-Est de l’OMS, la présence de marqueurs moléculaires de résistance à l’artémisinine a été rapportée au Bangladesh, en Inde, au Myanmar et en Thaïlande. À l’exception du Myanmar, les taux d’échec des ACT de première intention contre les infections à P. falciparum se sont avérés supérieurs à 10 % et ont même atteint 93 % en Thaïlande. Concernant les infections à P. vivax, la plupart des pays continuent d’enregistrer une grande efficacité de la chloroquine (CQ), sauf au Myanmar et au Timor-Leste. ■ Dans la région Méditerranée orientale de l’OMS, les taux d’échec importants des traitements à base d’AS-SP contre les infections à P. falciparum en Somalie et au Soudan ont induit un changement dans la politique du traitement de première intention en faveur de l’AL. Concernant les infections à P. vivax, l’efficacité des traitements à base d’AL et de CQ est élevée dans tous les pays où une étude sur leur efficacité thérapeutique a été menée. Résistance aux insecticides ■ De 2010 à 2018, quelque 81 pays ont transmis à l’OMS des données de surveillance sur la résistance aux insecticides. ■ Sur les 81 pays d’endémie palustre ayant fourni des données pour la période 2010-2018, la résistance à au moins une des quatre classes d’insecticides chez l’un des vecteurs du paludisme sur un site de collecte a été détectée dans 73 pays. Il s’agit là d’une augmentation de cinq pays par rapport à la période précédente de 2010-2017. Dans 26 pays, la résistance a été rapportée à toutes les principales classes d’insecticides. ■ La résistance aux pyréthoïdes, la seule classe d’insecticides actuellement utilisés dans les MII, est répandue. Elle a été détectée chez au moins un des vecteurs du paludisme sur plus des deux tiers des sites testés et s’est avérée la plus élevée dans les régions Afrique et Méditerranée orientale de l’OMS. ■ La résistance aux organochlorés a été détectée chez au moins un des vecteurs du paludisme sur près des deux tiers des sites. La résistance aux carbamates et aux organophosphorés a été moins prévalente, mais a été détectée, respectivement, sur 31 % et 26 % des sites testés. La résistance la plus prévalente aux carbamates a été détectée dans la région Asie du Sud-Est de l’OMS, et aux organophosphorés dans les régions Asie du Sud-Est et Pacifique occidental de l’OMS. ■ Toutes les données standard sur la résistance aux insecticides rapportées à l’OMS sont intégrées à la base de données mondiales de l’OMS sur la résistance aux insecticides, et leur accès à des fins d’exploration est possible via la Carte des menaces du paludisme. Cet outil en ligne a été enrichi en 2019 pour couvrir les espèces de moustiques envahissantes et présente à l’heure actuelle la dimension géographique des rapports sur la détection des espèces Anopheles stephensi. ■ Pour orienter la gestion de la résistance, les pays doivent développer et mettre en œuvre des plans nationaux de suivi et de gestion de la résistance aux insecticides, en se basant sur le Cadre conceptuel d’un plan national de suivi et de gestion de la résistance aux insecticides chez les vecteurs du paludisme élaboré par l’OMS. En 2018, 45 pays ont indiqué avoir établi un plan de suivi et de gestion de la résistance, et 36 en étaient encore à la phase de développement. ■ Les PNLP et leurs partenaires devraient envisager de déployer des moustiquaires imprégnées de butoxyde de pipéronyle (PBO) dans les zones géographiques où les principaux vecteurs du paludisme répondent aux critères recommandés par l’OMS en 2017, plutôt qu’en partant du principe que tout le pays doit répondre à ces critères. xxix 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Prefacio Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director General Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) No dejar a nadie atrás en la marcha hacia un mundo libre de malaria El flagelo de la malaria continúa golpeando con más fuerza a las mujeres embarazadas y a los niños en África. El Informe mundial sobre la malaria 2019 incluye una sección especial centrada en la carga y las consecuencias de la enfermedad entre estos dos grupos de mayor riesgo. Transmite un mensaje claro: todos debemos hacer más para proteger a los más vulnerables en la lucha contra una enfermedad que sigue cobrando más de 400 000 vidas cada año. La malaria en el embarazo compromete la salud de la madre y la pone en mayor riesgo de muerte. Afecta la salud del feto, lo que lleva a la prematuridad y al bajo peso al nacer, los principales contribuyentes de la mortalidad neonatal e infantil. El año pasado, unos 11 millones de mujeres embarazadas en África subsahariana se infectaron con malaria y, en consecuencia, casi 900 000 niños nacieron con bajo peso al nacer. Para proteger a las mujeres embarazadas en África, la OMS recomienda el uso de mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas (MTI) y medicamentos antimaláricos preventivos. Este informe muestra el progreso en ambos frentes. Aún así, casi el 40% de las mujeres embarazadas no durmieron bajo un MTI en 2018 y dos tercios no recibieron las tres o más dosis recomendadas de terapia preventiva. En los niños, los esfuerzos para ampliar el acceso a los medicamentos antipalúdicos preventivos están dando frutos. En la subregión del Sahel de África, la OMS recomienda la quimio-prevención de la malaria estacional durante la temporada alta de transmisión. Más del 60% de los niños que viven en áreas elegibles para esta terapia preventiva la recibieron en 2018. Se debe elogiar a Sierra Leona por convertirse en el primer país de África en implementar un tratamiento preventivo intermitente en infantes, otro enfoque recomendado por la OMS para proteger a los niños pequeños en las áreas afectadas por la malaria. Aún así, el acceso a la atención de los niños que muestran signos de fiebre sigue siendo demasiado bajo. Las encuestas de países muestran que casi 40% de los niños febriles en África subsahariana no son atendidos por un proveedor de atención médica capacitado. Al menos 10 países que forman parte de la “Iniciativa E-2020” de la OMS están en camino de alcanzar la eliminación en 2020, hito de nuestra estrategia mundial contra la malaria. En 2015, todos estos países eran endémicos de malaria; ahora han logrado cero casos autóctonos de malaria o se están acercando a ésta meta. Sin embargo, en los últimos años, el progreso global de la reducción de nuevos casos de malaria se ha estabilizado. Lo más preocupante de todo es que la malaria está en aumento en algunos países de alta carga en África. Es probable que se pierdan los hitos críticos de nuestra estrategia global contra la malaria. xxx

En 2018, la OMS y la Alianza para Hacer Retroceder la Malaria lanzaron el nuevo enfoque de "Alta carga a alto impacto”, para prevenir la enfermedad y salvar vidas en los países más afectados por la malaria. Reemplazando una estrategia de "talla única", el enfoque requiere el uso de las herramientas más efectivas de una manera más específica. Me complace observar que dos países, India y Uganda, han reportado reducciones sustanciales en los casos de malaria en 2018 comparado con el año anterior. En septiembre, emití el "Reto de la malaria", que pedía una mayor inversión en investigación y el desarrollo de nuevas herramientas, tecnologías y enfoques transformadores para acelerar el progreso en la lucha contra esta enfermedad. A través de un programa piloto coordinado por la OMS, Ghana, Kenia y Malawi introdujeron recientemente, en áreas seleccionadas, la primera vacuna contra la malaria del mundo. La evidencia y la experiencia del programa informarán las decisiones de política sobre el posible uso más amplio de la vacuna en África. Con el apoyo del Fondo Mundial para la lucha contra el VIH/SIDA, la tuberculosis y la malaria y del Unitaid, se están probando otras herramientas prometedoras, como nuevos tipos de mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas e intervenciones dirigidas a los mosquitos que pican fuera de las viviendas. Lograr nuestra visión común de un mundo libre de malaria también requerirá mejorar acciones en otras áreas críticas. Necesitamos servicios de salud asequibles y centrados en las personas. Necesitamos sistemas de vigilancia y respuesta confiables y precisos. Necesitamos estrategias que se adapten a los entornos locales de transmisión de la malaria. Acelerar el financiamiento para responder a la malaria es esencial. En 2018, el financiamiento total para el control y la eliminación de la malaria alcanzó un estimado de US $ 2.7 mil millones, muy por debajo del objetivo de financiamiento de US $ 5 mil millones de nuestra estrategia global. A través de una financiación sólida y decidida, liderazgo político y cobertura de salud universal, podemos vencer esta enfermedad de una vez por todas. xxxi 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

El informe de este año de un vistazo TENDENCIAS REGIONALES Y MUNDIALES SOBRE LA CARGA DE CASOS Y MUERTES POR MALARIA Casos de malaria ■ En 2018, se estima que hubo 228 millones de casos de malaria en todo el mundo (intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%: 206–258 millones), en comparación con 251 millones de casos en 2010 (IC del 95%: 231–278 millones) y 231 millones de casos en 2017 (IC 95%: 211–259 millones). ■ La mayoría de los casos de malaria en 2018 se produjeron en la Región de África de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) (213 millones o 93%), seguida de la Región de Asia Sudoriental con el 3,4% de los casos y la Región del Mediterráneo Oriental con el 2.1%. ■ Diecinueve países en África subsahariana1 e India sumaron casi el 85% de la carga mundial de malaria. Mas de la mitad de todos los casos de malaria en todo el mundo se concentró en seis países: Nigeria (25%), la República Democrática del Congo (12%), Uganda (5%) y Costa de Marfil, Mozambique y Níger (4% cada uno). ■ La tasa de incidencia de la malaria disminuyó a nivel mundial entre 2010 y 2018, de 71 a 57 casos por 1000 habitantes en riesgo. Sin embargo, de 2014 a 2018, la tasa de cambio disminuyó drásticamente, reduciendo a 57 en 2014 y permaneciendo en niveles similares hasta 2018. ■ En la Región de Asia Sudoriental de la OMS la tasa de incidencia continúo disminuyendo: de 17 casos por cada 1000 habitantes en riesgo en 2010 a cinco casos en 2018 (una disminución del 70%). En la Región de África, los niveles de incidencia de casos también disminuyeron de 294 en 2010 a 229 en 2018, lo que representa una reducción del 22%. Todas las demás regiones de la OMS registraron poco progreso o un aumento en la tasa de incidencia. La Región de las Américas de la OMS registró un aumento, en gran parte debido a los aumentos en la transmisión de la malaria en la República Bolivariana de Venezuela. ■ Entre 2015 y 2018, solo 31 países endémicos redujeron significativamente la incidencia de casos y estaban en camino de reducir la incidencia en un 40% o más en el año 2020. Sin un cambio acelerado, los hitos de la Estrategia Técnica Mundial contra la malaria 2016–2030 (ETM) relacionados con la morbilidad en 2025 y 2030 no se van a lograr. ■ Plasmodium falciparum es el parásito de la malaria más frecuente en la Región de África de la OMS, representando el 99.7% de los casos estimados de malaria en 2018, así como en la Región de Asia Sudoriental de la OMS (50%), Región del Mediterráneo Oriental (71%) y Región del Pacífico occidental (65%). ■ A nivel mundial, el 53% de la carga de P. vivax se concentra en la Región de Asia Sudoriental de la OMS, con la mayoría en India (47%). P. vivax es el parásito predominante en la Región de las Américas, representando el 75% de los casos de malaria. Muertes por malaria ■ En 2018, se estimaron 405 000 muertes por malaria en todo el mundo, comparado con 416 000 muertes estimadas en 2017 y 585 000 en 2010. ■ Los niños menores de 5 años son el grupo más vulnerable afectado por la malaria. En 2018, este grupo represento el 67% (272 000) de todas las muertes por malaria en todo el mundo. 1 La lista completa de países del África subsahariana puede consultarse en https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49; Sudan ha sido incluido como país subsahariano en todos los análisis llevados a cabo para este informe para esta región. xxxii

■ El 94% de todas las muertes por malaria en 2018 se produjo en la Región de África de la OMS. A pesar de ser la región que albergó la mayor cantidad de muertes por malaria en 2018, también es la región donde se produjo 85% de la reducción de muertes conseguida globalmente en 2018, 180 000 muertes de menos en comparación con 2010. ■ Casi el 85% de las muertes por malaria en el mundo en 2018 se concentraron en 20 países de la Región de África de la OMS y la India. Nigeria representó casi el 50% de todas las muertes por malaria en el mundo, seguida de la República Democrática del Congo (11%), la República Unida de Tanzania (5%) y Angola, Mozambique y Níger (4% cada uno). ■ En 2018, solo la Región de África de la OMS y la Región de Asia Sudoriental mostraron reducciones en las muertes por malaria en comparación con 2010. La Región de África tuvo la mayor reducción absoluta en las muertes por malaria, de 533 000 en 2010 a 380 000 en 2018. Sin embargo, a pesar de estas ganancias, la tasa de reducción de la mortalidad por malaria en esta región también se ha desacelerado desde 2016. CONSECUENCIAS DE LA MALARIA PARA LA SALUD MATERNA, DE LOS INFANTES Y LOS NIÑOS ■ En 2018, alrededor de 11 millones de embarazos en países con transmisión de malaria moderada y alta en el África subsahariana, habrían estado expuestas a una infección por malaria. ■ En 2018, la prevalencia de exposición a infección por malaria durante el embarazo fue más alta en la subregión de África occidental y África central (cada una con un 35%), seguida de África oriental y Suráfrica (20%). Alrededor del 39% de esta exposición se concentró en la República Democrática del Congo y Nigeria. ■ Los 11 millones de mujeres embarazadas expuestas a infecciones por malaria en 2018 dieron a luz a unos 872 000 niños con bajo peso al nacer (16% de todos los niños con bajo peso al nacer en estos países), con África Occidental teniendo la mayor prevalencia de niños con bajo peso al nacer atribuido a malaria durante el embarazo. ■ Entre 2015 y 2018 en 21 países con carga de malaria de moderada a alta en la Región de África de la OMS, la prevalencia de anemia en niños menores de 5 años con una prueba de diagnóstico rápido (PDR) positivo fue el doble que la de los niños con una PDR negativa. En los niños con malaria confirmada, el 9% tenía anemia severa y el 54% tenía anemia moderada; en contraste, en los niños sin malaria, solo el 1% tenía anemia severa y el 31% tenía anemia moderada. ■ Los países con el mayor porcentaje de anemia severa entre los niños menores de 5 años con malaria confirmada fueron Senegal (26%), Malí (16%), Guinea (14%) y Mozambique (12%). Para la mayoría de los otros países, la anemia severa varió del 5% al 10%. ■ En general, se estimó que alrededor de 24 millones de niños estaban infectados con P. falciparum en 2018 en África subsahariana, y se estima que 1.8 millones de ellos tenían anemia severa. ENFOQUE DE ALTA CARGA A ALTO IMPACTO ■ En 2018, hubo alrededor de 155 millones de casos de malaria en los 11 países incluidos en el enfoque alta carga a alto impacto (ACAI), en comparación con 177 millones en 2010. La República Democrática del Congo y Nigeria tuvieron 84 millones (54% del total de casos). ■ De los 10 países con mayor carga de malaria en África, Ghana y Nigeria reportaron, en 2018, los aumentos absolutos de casos más altos en comparación con 2017. La carga en 2018 fue similar a la de 2017 en los otros países, exceptuando Uganda e India, donde, en 2018, se reportó una reducción de 1.5 y 2.6 millones de casos, respectivamente en comparación con 2017. xxxiii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

■ Las muertes por malaria se redujeron de aproximadamente de 400 000 en 2010 a aproximadamente 260 000 en 2018. La mayor reducción se produjo en Nigeria, donde las casi 153 000 muertes en 2010 pasaron a aproximadamente 95 000 en 2018. ■ Para el año 2018, en todos los 11 países del enfoque ACAI, al menos el 40% de la población en riesgo durmió bajo mosquiteros tratados con insecticida de larga duración (MILD), el porcentaje más alto lo tuvo Uganda (80%) y el más bajo Nigeria (40%). ■ En Burkina Faso y la República Unida de Tanzania, se estimó que más de la mitad de las mujeres embarazadas recibieron tres dosis de tratamiento preventivo intermitente durante el embarazo (TPI) en 2018. En Camerún, Nigeria y Uganda, la cobertura estimada fue de alrededor del 30% o menos. ■ Seis países de la subregión africana del Sahel implementaron la quimio-prevención estacional de malaria (QPE) en 2018; de los 26 millones de niños objetivo, un total de 17 millones de niños, fueron tratados con QPE. ■ El porcentaje de niños menores de 5 años con fiebre que buscaron tratamiento varió del 58% en Malí al 82% en Uganda. En la República Democrática del Congo y Malí, más del 40% de los niños no fueron llevados a recibir tratamiento. El porcentaje de niños que fueron diagnosticados también fue preocupantemente bajo entre los niños que fueron sometidos a tratamiento, con un 30% o menos de niños que fueron diagnosticados en Camerún, la República Democrática del Congo y Nigeria. ■ A excepción de la India, en los países ACAI la inversión interna directa sigue siendo muy baja en relación con la financiación internacional. ELIMINACIÓN DE LA MALARIA Y PREVENCIÓN DEL RESTABLECIMIENTO ■ A nivel mundial, la red de eliminación se está ampliando, con más países avanzando hacia el objetivo de cero casos autóctonos: en 2018, 49 países reportaron menos de 10 000 de estos casos, frente a 46 países en 2017 y 40 países en 2010. El número de países con menos de 100 casos autóctonos, -un fuerte indicador de que la eliminación está cerca-, aumentó de 17 países en 2010 a 25 países en 2017 y 27 países en 2018. ■ Paraguay y Uzbekistán obtuvieron la certificación de eliminación de la OMS en 2018, y Argelia y Argentina lograron la certificación a principios de 2019. En 2018, China, El Salvador, Irán, Malasia y Timor-Leste reportaron cero casos autóctonos. ■ Uno de los hitos clave de la ETM para 2020 es la eliminación de la malaria en al menos 10 países de los que eran endémicos de malaria en 2015. Al ritmo actual de progreso, es probable que se alcance este hito. ■ En 2016, la OMS identificó 21 países con el potencial de eliminar la malaria para el año 2020. La OMS está trabajando con los gobiernos de estos países, conocidos como “países E-2020”, para apoyar sus objetivos de aceleración de la eliminación. ■ Aunque hay 10 países del E-2020 que están en el buen camino para lograr sus objetivos de eliminación, en 2018 Comoros y Costa Rica informaron de aumentos en los casos de malaria autóctonos en comparación con 2017. ■ En los seis países de la subregión del Gran Mekong (GM) - Camboya, China (provincia de Yunnan), República Democrática Popular Laos, Myanmar, Tailandia y Vietnam - el número de casos de malaria disminuyó en un 76% entre 2010 y 2018, y las muertes por malaria disminuyeron en un 95% durante el mismo período. En 2018, Camboya, por primera vez en la historia, reportó de que no hubo muertes relacionadas con la malaria denle el país. xxxiv

INVERSIONES EN LOS PROGRAMAS DE MALARIA E INVESTIGACIÓN ■ En 2018, los gobiernos de los países endémicos de malaria y sus colaboradores internacionales invirtieron aproximadamente $ 2.700 millones en esfuerzos de control y eliminación de la malaria a nivel mundial, menos que los $ 3.200 millones que se invirtieron en 2017. La cantidad invertida en 2018 es insuficiente dado que se estima que se requieren $ 5.0 mil millones para continuar avanzando hacia el complimiento de los objetivos de la ETM. ■ Casi tres cuartas partes de las inversiones en 2018 se gastaron en la Región de África de la OMS, seguidas por la Región de las Américas (7%), la Región de Asia Sudoriental (6%), la Región del Mediterráneo Oriental y la Región del Pacífico Occidental (5% cada uno). ■ En 2018, el 47% de la financiación total para la malaria se invirtió en países de bajos ingresos, el 43% en países de ingresos bajo a medio y el 11% en países de ingresos medio a alto. La financiación internacional representó la principal fuente de financiación en los países de bajos y de bajo a medios ingresos, con 85% y 61% respectivamente. La financiación interna se ha mantenido estable desde 2010. ■ De los $ 2.700 millones de dólares invertidos en 2018, $ 1.800 millones provienen de financiadores internacionales. Los gobiernos de los países endémicos contribuyeron con el 30% de la financiación total ($ 900 millones de dólares) en 2018, una cifra sin cambios desde 2017. Dos tercios de los fondos de origen nacional se invirtieron en actividades de control de la malaria llevadas a cabo por los programas nacionales de malaria (PNM), siendo el resto estimado como el costo de atención a los pacientes. ■ Como en años anteriores, los Estados Unidos de América (EE. UU.) Fue la mayor fuente internacional de financiación de la malaria, proporcionando $ 1 mil millones de dólares (37%) en 2018. Los países miembros del Comité de Asistencia para el Desarrollo representaron $ 300 millones (11%). El Reino Unido de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte contribuyeron con alrededor de $ 200 millones (7%). ■ De los $ 2.700 millones de dólares invertidos en 2018, $ 1.000 millones se canalizaron a través del Fondo Mundial de Lucha contra el SIDA, la Tuberculosis y la Malaria. ■ Aunque la financiación para la malaria se ha mantenido relativamente estable desde 2010, el nivel de inversión en 2018 está lejos de lo que se requiere para alcanzar los dos primeros hitos de la ETM; es decir, conseguir, para el 2020, una reducción de al menos el 40% en la incidencia de casos de malaria y en las tasas de mortalidad a nivel mundial en comparación con los niveles de 2015. ■ Se invirtieron $ 663 millones de dólares en investigación básica y desarrollo de productos para la malaria en 2018, un aumento de $ 18 millones en comparación con 2017. ■ La financiación para investigación y desarrollo de medicamentos antimaláricos llego al nivel más alto jamás registrado, de $ 228 millones en 2017 a $ 252 millones de dólares en 2018. Este aumento fue el resultado de la inversión del sector privado en varios ensayos de Fase II de nuevos productos con potencial de curación radical con una dosis única. Distribución de productos básicos contra la malaria Mosquiteros tratados con insecticida ■ Entre 2016 y 2018, de acuerdo con los fabricantes, se entregaron 578 millones de mosquiteros tratados con insecticida (MTI), principalmente MILD, con un 50% destinado a Costa de Marfil, República Democrática del Congo, Etiopía, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Uganda y la República Unida de Tanzania. ■ En 2018, los fabricantes entregaron alrededor de 197 millones de MILD, de los cuales más del 87% fueron entregados a países del África subsahariana. ■ A nivel mundial, el 85% de los MTI se distribuyeron a través de campañas gratuitas de distribución masiva, el 10% en centros de atención prenatal y el 6% como parte de los programas de inmunización. xxxv 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

Pruebas de diagnóstico rápido (PDR). ■ Se estima que 412 millones de PDR se vendieron a nivel mundial en 2018. ■ En 2018, los PNM distribuyeron 259 millones de PDR. La mayoría de las PDR (64%) fueron pruebas para detectar P. falciparum y se suministraron al África subsahariana. Terapia combinada basada en artemisinina ■ Se estima que 3,000 millones de tratamientos de terapia combinada basada en artemisinina (TCA) fueron adquiridos por los países durante el período 2010-2018 y que el 63% fue adquirido por el sector público. ■ En 2018, los PNM distribuyeron 214 millones de tratamientos con TCA, el 98% fueron en la Región de África de la OMS. PREVENCIÓN DE LA MALARIA Control de vectores ■ La mitad de las personas en riesgo de malaria en África están durmiendo bajo un MTI; en 2018, el 50% de la población estaba protegida por esta intervención, un aumento del 29% comparado con 2010. Además, el porcentaje de la población con acceso a un MTI aumentó del 33% en 2010 al 57% en 2018. Sin embargo, la cobertura mejoró solo marginalmente desde 2015 y se ha estancado desde 2016. ■ El porcentaje de hogares con al menos un MTI por cada dos personas aumentaron a 72% en 2018, de 47% en 2010. Sin embargo, esta cifra representa solo un aumento modesto en los últimos 3 años, y sigue estando lejos del objetivo de cobertura universal. ■ El número de personas en riesgo de contraer malaria protegidas por el rociado residual intradomiciliar (RRI), un método de prevención que implica el rociado de insecticidas en las paredes interiores de las viviendas, está disminuyendo. A nivel mundial, la protección del RRI disminuyó de un pico del 5% en 2010 al 2% en 2018, año en el que se observaron disminuciones en todas las regiones de la OMS, salvo en la Región del Mediterráneo Oriental. ■ Aunque la cobertura del RRI en la Región de África de la OMS cayo de 180 millones de personas en riesgo protegidas en 2010 a 93 millones en 2018, la cobertura disminuyó de 13 millones de personas entre 2017 y 2018. ■ La disminución de la cobertura del RRI puede deberse los cambios en los insecticidas usados, la transición de piretroides a insecticidas más caros en respuesta al aumento de la resistencia a los piretroides; o a cambios en las estrategias operativas (por ejemplo, la disminución de las poblaciones en riesgo en los países en vías de eliminación de la malaria). Terapias preventivas ■ Para proteger a las mujeres en áreas de transmisión de malaria moderada y alta en África, la OMS recomienda TPI con el antimalárico sulfadoxina-pirimetamina (SP). Entre los 36 países africanos que informaron sobre los niveles de cobertura de TPI en 2018, se estima que el 31% de las mujeres embarazadas elegibles recibieron las tres o más dosis recomendadas de TPI, en comparación con el 22% en 2017 y el 0% en 2010, lo que indica mejoras considerables en la implementación de esta intervención en los países. ■ Alrededor del 18% de las mujeres que utilizaron los servicios de atención prenatal al menos una vez, no recibieron ninguna dosis de TPI, lo que representa una oportunidad perdida que, si se aprovecha, podría mejorar considerablemente y rápidamente la cobertura de TPI. ■ En 2018, 19 millones de niños en 12 países de la subregión del Sahel de África fueron protegidos a través de programas de quimio-prevención estacional (QPE). Todos los niños seleccionados recibieron tratamiento en Camerún, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau y Malí. Sin embargo, unos 12 millones de niños que podrían haberse beneficiado de esta intervención no lo hicieron. Esto es debido principalmente a la falta de fondos. xxxvi

PRUEBAS DE DIAGNÓSTICO Y TRATAMIENTO Acceso a la atención médica ■ El diagnóstico y el tratamiento oportunos son la forma más efectiva de evitar que un caso leve de malaria se convierta en enfermedad grave y que cause la muerte. Según las encuestas nacionales de hogares realizadas en 20 países del África subsahariana entre 2015 y 2018, una mediana del 42% (rango inter-cuartil [RI]: 34-49%) de los niños con fiebre (febriles) fueron trasladados a un proveedor de atención médica capacitado en el sector público, comparado con el 10% (RI: 8–22%) en el sector privado formal y el 3% (RI: 2–7%) en el sector privado informal. ■ Una alta proporción de niños febriles no recibió atención médica (mediana: 36%, RI: 28–45%). El pobre acceso a los proveedores de atención médica o la falta de conocimiento de los síntomas de la malaria entre los cuidadores son algunos de los factores que contribuyen a esta falta de atención médica. Diagnóstico de la malaria ■ El porcentaje de pacientes con sospecha de malaria, que son atendidos en centros de salud pública y examinados con una PDR o microscopía, aumentó del 38% en 2010 al 85% en 2018. ■ En 2018, en el 71% de los países con transmisión moderada a alta en el África subsahariana, el porcentaje de casos con sospecha de malaria a quienes se les realizó una prueba parasitológica fue superior al 80%. ■ Según 19 encuestas de hogares a nivel nacional, realizadas entre 2015 y 2018 en África subsahariana, el porcentaje promedio de niños febriles que fueron atendidos y recibieron un pinchazo en el dedo o el talón (lo que sugiere que pudo haberse realizado una prueba de diagnóstico de malaria) fue mayor en el sector público (mediana: 66%, RI: 49–75%) que en el sector privado formal (mediana: 40%, RI: 16–46%) o el sector privado informal (mediana: 9%, RI: 5– 22%). ■ Según 61 encuestas de hogares realizadas en 29 países del África subsahariana entre 2010 y 2018, el porcentaje de niños con fiebre que recibieron una prueba de diagnóstico antes de recibir tratamiento antimalárico en el sector de la salud pública aumentó de una mediana del 48% (RI: 30 –62%) en 2010–2013, a una mediana del 76% (RI: 60–86%) en 2015–2018. Tratamiento de la malaria ■ Según 20 encuestas de hogares realizadas en África subsahariana en 2015–2018, el porcentaje medio de niños febriles que fueron tratados con algún medicamento antimalárico fue mayor en el sector público (mediana: 48%, RI: 30–69%) que en el sector privado formal (mediana: 40%, RI: 21–51%) o el sector privado informal (mediana: 18%, RI: 10–29%). ■ Los datos de 20 encuestas nacionales realizados en África subsahariana muestran que, para el período 2015–2018, el 47% (RI: 29–69%) de los niños febriles que recibieron tratamiento para la malaria en el sector de la salud pública recibieron tratamiento antimalárico, en comparación con 59% (RI: 53–84%) entre quienes visitan a un trabajador de salud comunitario y 49% (RI: 19–55%) en el sector privado formal. ■ Con base en 19 encuestas de hogares, los tratamientos antimaláricos dados a los niños febriles fueron más frecuentemente un TCA cuando se buscó tratamiento en el sector público (mediana: 80%, RI: 45-94%) que en el sector privado formal (mediana: 77%, RI: 43–87%) o el sector privado informal (mediana: 60%, RI: 40–84%). ■ Para cerrar la brecha de tratamiento a los niños, la OMS recomienda la adopción del manejo integrado de casos por la comunidad (MICC). Este enfoque promueve el manejo integrado de condiciones de salud que comúnmente amenazan la vida de los niños (malaria, neumonía y diarrea) a nivel de centros de salud y comunitarios. En 2018, 30 países implementaron el MICC en diferentes niveles, con solo unos pocos implementando ésta a nivel nacional. xxxvii 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

SISTEMAS DE VIGILANCIA DE LA MALARIA ■ El pilar 3 de la Estrategia Mundial de malaria (ETM) es transformar la vigilancia de malaria en una intervención principal. Para comprender si los sistemas de vigilancia de la malaria son adecuados para su propósito, la OMS recomienda el monitoreo y la evaluación regulares de los sistemas de vigilancia. ■ El Programa Global contra la Malaria (PGM), en colaboración con la Universidad de Oslo, ha desarrollado módulos estandarizados de vigilancia de malaria basados en el Software de Información de Salud del Distrito-2 (DHIS2) para la recogida de datos epidemiológicos de rutina, datos de casos individuales y datos de vigilancia entomológica y monitoria de intervenciones de control vectorial. Estos modules incluyen elementos de datos, indicadores de monitoria y de calidad de los datos, tableros estandarizados de interpretación de los datos e informes. ■ Hasta octubre de 2019, 23 países han instalado el módulo agregado de malaria de la OMS, otras ocho instalaciones están planificadas para el próximo año y otros cinco países ya han desarrollado e integrado su propio módulo para la vigilancia de malaria en DHIS2. ■ La OMS ha estado trabajando en coordinación con los departamentos de Sistemas de Información de Gestión de Salud (SIGS) de los ministerios de salud, en particular de los países ACAI, para establecer bases de datos dinámicas estructuradas conocidas como repositorios de datos. El PGM ha desarrollado una estructura de repositorio standard basada en DHIS2 y fácilmente adaptable, que contiene los elementos de datos e indicadores más relevantes, sus definiciones y computación para cubrir las áreas temáticas clave. Hasta ahora, el trabajo para desarrollar estas bases de datos ha comenzado en Gambia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda y la República Unida de Tanzania. ■ La OMS también alienta a los países a implementar evaluaciones del sistema de vigilancia. Un ejemplo de estudio de caso de Mozambique ilustra tal evaluación y su papel en la mejora de los sistemas de vigilancia. RESPONDIENDO A LOS DESAFÍOS BIOLÓGICAS EN LA LUCHA CONTRA LA MALARIA Supresión del gen Pfhrp2 / 3 ■ La supresión de los genes pfhrp2 y pfhrp3 (pfhrp2 / 3) del parásito hacen que los parásitos sean indetectables por las PDR que se basan en la detección del HRP2. La supresión doble pfhrp2 y pfhrp3 entre pacientes sintomáticos ha alcanzado una prevalencia de hasta el 80% en Eritrea y Perú. ■ La OMS ha recomendado a los países con evidencia de supresiones de pfhrp2 / 3, o los países vecinos, que realicen encuestas representativas entre los casos sospechosos de malaria para determinar si la prevalencia de supresión de pfhrp2 / 3, que causan falsos negativos en las PDR, ha alcanzado un umbral que indique la necesidad de cambio de PDR (> 5 % de deleciones en pfhrp2 causan resultados de falsos negativos en PDR). ■ La OMS está rastreando los informes publicados de supresiones pfhrp2 / 3 utilizando la herramienta de mapeo del Mapa de los Desafíos de la Malaria. Hasta la fecha, 28 países han reportado supresiones de pfhrp2. Resistencia a los medicamentos antimaláricos ■ Las mutaciones de PfKelch13 se han identificado como marcadores moleculares de resistencia parcial a la artemisinina. Las mutaciones de PfKelch13 asociadas con la resistencia a la artemisinina están muy extendidas en la subregión del Gran Mekong (GM) y también se han detectado con una prevalencia significativa (más del 5%) en Guyana, Papua Nueva Guinea y Ruanda. En el caso de Ruanda, se ha visto que la presencia de mutaciones PfKelch13 no afecta la eficacia del tratamiento de primera línea. xxxviii

■ En la Región del Pacífico Occidental de la OMS, la resistencia a la artemisinina se ha confirmado en Camboya, República Democrática Popular Lao y Vietnam a través de varios estudios realizados entre 2001 y 2018. La eficacia del tratamiento para P. vivax sigue siendo alta en todos los países, las tasas de fallo del tratamiento son inferiores al 10 %. ■ En la Región de África, las tasas de eficacia de arteméter-lumefantrina (AL), artesunato- amodiaquina (AS-AQ) y dihidroartemisinina-piperaquina (DHA-PPQ) para P. falciparum fueron más del 98%, y la eficacia se ha mantenido alta a lo largo del tiempo. ■ En la Región de las Américas, la eficacia del tratamiento para P. falciparum, contratamientos de primera línea, sigue siendo alta. ■ En la Región de Asia Sudoriental, se han encontrado marcadores moleculares de resistencia a la artemisinina en Bangladesh, India, Myanmar y Tailandia. Con excepción de Myanmar, las tasas de fallo de los TCA de primera línea para P. falciparum fueron mayores que 10% y llegaron hasta el 93% en Tailandia. Con base a los estudios de eficacia terapéutica reportados, la cloroquina (CQ) sigue siendo altamente eficaz contra P. vivax en la mayoría de los países, excepto en Myanmar y Timor-Leste. ■ En la Región del Mediterráneo Oriental, las altas tasas de fallo del tratamiento con AS-SP contra P. falciparum detectadas en Somalia y Sudán llevaron a un cambio en la política de tratamiento de primera línea que ahora es AL. Los estudios de eficacia terapéutica (EET) realizados con AL y CQ contra P. vivax indican una alta eficacia de estos tratamientos. Resistencia a los insecticidas ■ Desde 2010 hasta 2018, unos 81 países informaron datos a la OMS sobre el monitoreo de la resistencia a los insecticidas. ■ De los 81 países endémicos de malaria que proporcionaron datos para 2010–2018, 73 confirmaron la resistencia a al menos una de las cuatro clases de insecticidas en al menos un vector de malaria y un sitio de recolección, un aumento de cinco países en comparación con el período del informe anterior 2010-2017. 26 países, confirmaron la resistencia a las cuatro clases principales de insecticidas. ■ La resistencia a los piretroides, la única clase de insecticidas actualmente utilizada en los MTI, es generalizada y se detectó en al menos un vector de malaria en más de dos tercios de los sitios analizados, y fue más alta en la Región de África de la OMS y en la Región del Mediterráneo Oriental. ■ La resistencia a los organoclorados fue confirmada en casi un tercio de los sitios de recolección en al menos un vector de malaria. La resistencia a los carbamatos y los organofosforados fue menos prevalente, siendo confirmada en el 31% y 26% de los sitios de recolección testados, respectivamente. La resistencia a los carbamatos fue más prevalente en la región de Asia sudoriental, mientras que la resistencia a los organofosforados fue más prevalente en la región de Asia sudoriental y el Pacifico Oriental. ■ Todos los datos estándar de resistencia a los insecticidas proporcionados a la OMS están incluidos en la Base de datos Mundial de Resistencia a los Insecticidas en los Vectores de Malaria de la OMS y están disponibles para su consulta a través del Mapa de los Desafíos de la Malaria. Esta herramienta en línea se extendió en 2019 para cubrir los movimientos de las especies de mosquitos invasoras, y actualmente muestra el alcance geográfico de los informes sobre la detección de Anopheles stephensi. ■ Para guiar el manejo de la resistencia, los países deben desarrollar e implementar un plan nacional para el monitoreo y manejo de la resistencia a los insecticidas, basándose en el documento Estructura general de un plan nacional de monitoreo y manejo de la resistencia a insecticidas en vectores del paludismo de la OMS. En 2018, un total de 45 países informaron haber completado el plan para el monitoreo y manejo de la resistencia y 36 estaban en proceso de desarrollarlo. ■ Los PNM y sus socios deberían considerar la distribución de mosquiteros con piretroide y butóxido de piperonilo (PBO) en áreas geográficas concretas donde los principales vectores de la malaria cumplen con los criterios recomendados por la OMS en 2017, en lugar de basarse en si todo el país cumple los criterios. xxxix 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW

FIG. 1.1. Countries with indigenous cases in 2000 and their status by 2018 Countries with zero indigenous cases over at least the past 3 consecutive years are considered as having eliminated malaria. In 2018, China and El Salvador reported zero indigenous cases for the second consecutive year, and Iran (Islamic Republic of), Malaysia and Timor-Leste reported zero indigenous cases for the first time.

2 Regional and global trends in burden of malaria cases and deaths Assessing progress in reducing the burden of malaria, to track the targets and milestones of the GTS (1), is a key mandate of the WHO Global Malaria Programme (GMP). This section of the report reviews the total number of cases and deaths estimated to have occurred between 2010 and 2018. There are several methods for estimating the burden of malaria cases and deaths; the method used depends on the quality of the national surveillance systems and the availability of data over time (Section 9.1 and Annex 1). 2.1 ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MALARIA CASES BY WHO REGION, 2000–2018 An estimated 228 million cases of malaria occurred (3.4%) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region worldwide in 2018 (95% confidence interval [CI]: (2.1%) (Table 2.1). Globally, 3.3% of all estimated cases 206–258 million) compared with 251 million cases in were caused by P. vivax, with 53% of the vivax burden 2010 (95% CI: 231–278 million) and 231 million cases in being in the WHO South-East Asia Region (Table 2.2). 2017 (95% CI: 211–259 million) (Table 2.1). P. vivax is the predominant parasite in the WHO Region of the Americas (75%), and is responsible for 50% of The WHO African Region still bears the largest burden cases in the WHO South-East Asia Region and 29% in of malaria morbidity, with 213 million cases (93%) in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (Table 2.2). 2018, followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region 9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 4

To illustrate the level of progress 405 000 malaria deaths (Table 2.3) in 2018.

While the gains to date are impressive, the global required to get the world on target for the 2020 malaria challenge remains enormous and the level of milestones, but current estimated incidence is at progress is slowing down. For example, on the current 57 cases per 1000 population at risk. If the current trajectory, globally, the 2020 GTS milestones for trend in incidence is maintained, estimated malaria morbidity will not be achieved, and without accelerated case incidence (per 1000 population at risk) would be change, the 2025 and 2030 milestones will not be 54 in 2020, 48 in 2025 and 42 in 2030, instead of the achieved.

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 3 Maternal, infant and child health consequences of malaria Malaria infection during pregnancy is a significant public health problem, with substantial risks for the pregnant woman, her fetus and the newborn child. The symptoms and complications of malaria in pregnancy vary according to malaria transmission intensity in the given geographical area, and the individual’s level of acquired immunity (7). Malaria-associated maternal illness and anaemia, preterm birth and low birthweight newborns are mostly the result of P. falciparum infection and occurs predominantly in Africa. Maternal anaemia, of which malaria remains an important contributor, puts the mother at increased risk of death before and after childbirth. This also leads to preterm births and children of low weight at birth, causing problems with child growth and cognitive development, as well as being major risk factors for perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality (8, 9). In moderate and high transmission settings, where levels of acquired immunity tend to be high, P. falciparum infection is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy. Nevertheless, parasites may be present in the placenta and contribute to maternal anaemia even in the absence of documented peripheral parasitaemia. Both maternal anaemia and placental parasitaemia can lead to low birthweight, which is an important contributor to infant mortality (7, 10, 11). In these settings, the adverse effects of P. falciparum infection in pregnancy are most pronounced for women in their first pregnancy. Infection with P. vivax leads to chronic anaemia, reducing the birthweight and increasing the risk of neonatal death. For women in their first pregnancy, the reduction in birthweight due to infection with P. vivax is about two thirds of the reduction associated with P. falciparum (12, 13). In addition to a higher risk of low birthweight, infants once again become susceptible to P. falciparum malaria when immunity acquired from the mother starts to wane. Infants are at increased risk of rapid disease progression, severe malaria (especially of the severe anaemia form) and death. To avert the consequences of malaria infections to pregnant women, fetuses, infants and children, WHO recommends – in combination with vector control, and prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria – the use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as part of antenatal care (ANC) (Section 7.3); and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) with SP in areas of moderate to high transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with amodiaquine plus SP in children aged under 5 years is recommended in 14 Africa’s Sahel subregion.

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW In this section, exposure to malaria infection during pregnancy is estimated, then that estimation is used to compute the risk and prevalence of low birthweight. The correlation between malaria in pregnancy and malaria anaemia is presented, as is the prevalence of anaemia in children aged under 5 years, with or without malaria infection, as measured during household surveys. The analysis is restricted to moderate to high transmission countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Annex 1), where burden of malaria in pregnancy, infants and children is greatest. 3.1 PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE TO MALARIA INFECTION DURING PREGNANCY, CORRELATION WITH MATERNAL ANAEMIA AND CONTRIBUTION TO LOW BIRTHWEIGHT Anaemia is characterized by a decrease in the number leads to maternal anaemia, which is associated with of red blood cells in the blood (or a decrease in higher risk of obstetric haemorrhage and death.

Anaemia is highly prevalent globally and is particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the WHO guidelines for treatment of malaria (36), a Hb concentration of less than 5 g/dL in an individual infected with malaria defines severe malaria. 2 https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1?lang=en; Maternal anaemia prevalence estimates are presented to 2016 and were kept the same for the 2018 estimates in this report. 3 https://dhsprogram.com/ 15

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 4 High burden to high impact approach In November 2018, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched the high burden to high impact (HBHI) country-led approach (23) as a mechanism to bring the 11 highest burden countries back on track to achieve the 2025 GTS milestones (1). This followed the results of the world malaria reports of 2017 (24) and 2018 (25), which showed that, globally, progress has stalled in high-burden countries and that the GTS 2020 milestones are, therefore, unlikely to be achieved. These 11 countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania) account for 70% of the global estimated case burden and 71% of global estimated deaths. Many factors contribute to the rising malaria burden in these, and other, high-burden countries, including the underlying intensity of malaria transmission, sociodemographic and epidemiologic risk factors, poor access to care and suboptimal malaria intervention coverage, and funding constraints. Consequently, the approach includes the four key response elements shown in Fig. 4.1, which have the aim of supporting countries to address their core country challenges so that they can get back on track towards the GTS milestones. 4.1 HBHI INITIATION ACTIVITIES By November 2019, the HBHI approach had been highlights in most countries in 2019 include launch or initiated in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic strengthening of social mobilization and advocacy Republic of Congo, Ghana, India, Mozambique, Niger, movements through the launching of the campaign Nigeria and Uganda.

Globally, the number of countries that were malaria endemic in 2000 and that reported fewer than 10 000 malaria cases increased from 40 in 2010 to 49 in 2018; in the same period, the number of countries with fewer than 100 indigenous cases increased from 17 to 27. Between 2017 and 2018, the number of countries with fewer than 10 indigenous cases increased from 19 to 24 (Fig. 5.1). The GTS milestone for 2020 is to eliminate malaria from at least 10 countries that were malaria endemic in 2015 (1). Between 2000 and 2018, 19 countries attained zero indigenous cases for 3 years or more (Table 5.1); four countries that were malaria endemic in 2015 have since eliminated malaria. In 2018, no malaria endemic country reached zero indigenous malaria cases for the third consecutive year. However, several countries recorded zero indigenous cases for the first time in 2018, or for a second consecutive year (Section 5.1). Certification of elimination by WHO is the official recognition of a country being free from indigenous malaria cases; this is based on an independent evaluation verifying the interruption of transmission and the country’s ability to prevent re-establishment of transmission. Paraguay and Uzbekistan were awarded WHO certification of elimination in 2018, with Algeria and Argentina achieving certification in early 2019. 5.1 E‑2020 INITIATIVE In April 2016, WHO published an assessment of the countries, referred to as the Global Forum of Malaria- likelihood of countries achieving malaria elimination Eliminating Countries (Global Forum), was organized by 2020.

Twenty-one countries, across five WHO regions, were In April 2018, WHO established the Malaria Elimination identified as being the most likely to reach zero Oversight Committee (MEOC) to help countries to indigenous cases by 2020. These countries were reach their elimination goals. The MEOC attended the termed as the “eliminating countries for 2020” 2018 and 2019 Global Forums and, in February 2019, (E-2020), and they are the special focus of WHO met with a small group of countries on track to reach efforts to accelerate national elimination efforts and malaria elimination by 2020, to support those countries monitor progress towards malaria free status in their attempts to achieve malaria elimination.

Estimates of the funding required to achieve these milestones have been set out in the GTS. Total annual resources needed were estimated at US$ 4.1 billion in 2016, rising to US$ 6.8 billion in 2020. An additional US$ 0.72 billion is estimated to be required annually for global malaria research and development (1). This section presents the most up-to-date funding trends for malaria control and elimination, by source and channel of funding for the period 2010–2018, both globally and for major country groupings. It then presents investments in malaria-related research and development (R&D) for the same period. A large proportion of the investment in malaria is spent on scaling up malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment. This section presents trends in the sales and in-country distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and RDTs. 6.1 FUNDING FOR MALARIA CONTROL AND ELIMINATION For the 91 countries analysed in this section, total the United States of America (USA) contributed a total funding for malaria control and elimination was of US$ 1.0 billion through planned bilateral funding estimated at US$ 2.7 billion in 2018, compared with and contributions to multilateral funding agencies, US$ 3.2 billion in 2017.

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 7 Preventing malaria For the prevention of malaria, WHO recommends vector control (i.e. reducing the chances of mosquitoes biting human beings) or chemoprevention (i.e. providing drugs that suppress infections) in specific population subgroups (i.e. pregnant women, children and other high-risk groups) or in specific contexts (e.g. complex emergencies and elimination). The core interventions recommended by WHO to prevent mosquito bites are sleeping under an ITN and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In a few specific settings and circumstances, ITNs and IRS can be supplemented by larval source management or other environmental modifications (29). With regard to chemoprevention, WHO recommends a number of context-specific interventions. In sub-Saharan Africa, IPTp with SP has been shown to reduce maternal anaemia, low birthweight and perinatal mortality (30). IPTi with SP provides protection against clinical malaria and anaemia (31). SMC with amodiaquine (AQ) plus SP (AQ+SP) for children aged 3–59 months reduces the incidence of clinical attacks and severe malaria by about 75%, and could avert millions of cases and thousands of deaths among children living in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission (32). Since March 2012, WHO has recommended SMC for children aged 3–59 months living in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission in the Sahel subregion of Africa. Mass drug administration is defined as the time-limited administration of antimalarial treatment to all age groups of a defined population or to every person living in a defined geographical area (except those for whom the medicine is contraindicated) at about the same time and at specific repeated intervals. It is recommended for malaria elimination settings in combination with high coverage of core interventions and as a means of rapidly reducing the malaria burden in epidemics and complex emergencies, as part of the rapid initial response (33). This section discusses the population-level coverage of ITNs, IRS, IPTp and SMC. Analysis of coverage indicators for ITNs is limited to sub-Saharan Africa, where there are sufficient household survey data to measure progress. IPTp and SMC are also reported only for sub-Saharan Africa, where these interventions are applicable. The coverage of IPTi is not reported because, as for 2018, no country has adopted it. In 2019, Sierra Leone began national scale-up of IPTi. 7.1 POPULATION AT RISK COVERED WITH ITNs Indicators of population-level coverage of ITNs were ■ percentage of households with at least one ITN for estimated for countries in sub-Saharan Africa in which every two people; ITNs are the main method of vector control.

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 8 Diagnostic testing and treatment Diagnostic testing and treatment is a key component of malaria control and elimination strategies. In addition to the treatment of uncomplicated malaria illness, prompt and effective case management helps to prevent severe disease and probable death; it may also reduce the pool of individuals who contribute to malaria transmission. Diagnosing patients rather than treating them presumptively may help health service providers to further investigate other potential causes of febrile illnesses that have a negative parasitological result, reduce the unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs and associated side-effects, and contribute to reducing the spread of drug resistance (36). The ability of health systems to provide quality malaria case management at high coverage is influenced by three indicators: the extent to which patients with suspected malaria seek treatment, receive a diagnostic test after seeking care, and (if that test is positive for malaria) receive appropriate treatment. These indicators are usually measured through household surveys, such as MIS and DHS. For reasons of data availability, the analysis in this section is largely confined to sub-Saharan Africa, the region that carries the highest share of the global malaria burden; it covers 4-year periods because most countries conduct household surveys once every 3–5 years. Annex 1 discusses the countries included, the calculation methods, and the limitations of the use of DHS and MIS data. The signs and symptoms of malaria are similar to those of many other febrile illnesses. In non-immune individuals, malaria typically presents with fever, sometimes accompanied by chills, sweats, headache or other symptoms that may resemble signs or symptoms of other febrile illnesses. Consequently, fever is the main basis for suspecting malaria and triggering diagnostic testing of the patient in most malaria endemic settings. A history of fever in children aged under 5 years and subsequent steps taken to seek treatment have been the basis of measuring access to malaria case management. However, some important limitations of these data are as follows: what constitutes a “fever” varies by cultural context, which means that making comparisons across cultural groups can be problematic; the percentage of fevers that are due to malaria varies according to the underlying transmission intensity and level of control; there is no conclusive evidence that the household-level and individual-level processes for making the decision to seek treatment for malaria fevers are the same as those for other fevers or across different ages; and a percentage of respondents may not recall the medication they received, resulting in misclassification of the drugs that were prescribed. 8.1 PREVALENCE OF FEVER IN CHILDREN AGED UNDER 5 YEARS Based on 20 household surveys conducted in sub- 6 months or over 3 years (Fig. 8.1). Prevalence of fever Saharan Africa between 2015 and 2018, a median of ranged from more than 40% in Malawi and Nigeria to 26% of children (interquartile range [IQR]: 19–35%) had less than 20% in Angola, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mali a fever in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. Children and Zimbabwe (Annex 3-Eb). However, the data aged 6 months to 3 years had a higher prevalence should be interpreted with caution because of potential (around 30%) of fever than children aged under bias in the season in which surveys are conducted. 52

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 9 Malaria surveillance Pillar 3 of the GTS (1) is to transform malaria surveillance into a core intervention. This requires surveillance systems that can accurately and reliably track the burden of malaria, the interventions to reduce it, and the impact achieved geographically and temporally. To understand whether malaria surveillance systems are fit for purpose, WHO recommends the regular monitoring and evaluation of surveillance systems (38). This involves assessment of the structure, core and support functions, and the quality of the data, across both passive and active case-detection systems. Such information is critical to the continuous improvement of surveillance systems. This section provides a summary of WHO initiatives to work with NMPs and partners in developing surveillance standards and tools to support the strengthening of national systems. It also presents an example of a country surveillance system assessment, to demonstrate the type of information such assessments provide and their potential role in improving surveillance systems (Box 9.1). 9.1 STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS Over the past 3 years, GMP has embarked on an (DHIS2),1 for burden reduction (aggregate data) intensified process of improving national surveillance and elimination (case-based data) settings, systems and the use of data for programmatic entomological surveillance and vector-control decision-making.

Technical, organizational and behavioural factors that influence key surveillance system processes and data quality were evaluated to assess the overall performance of MIS. The assessment focused on the public health sector. Results: Reporting completeness was more than 90% across all administrative levels, and completeness of key data fields was more than 80% (Fig. B.9.3). There were challenges, however, with receiving timely reports from ● Health centre CHWs, and accuracy of data was poor at both health facility ● Hospital and CHW levels. Also, a significant number of patients who ● Health post were tested with RDTs and confirmed cases treated with ACTs were not reported, which can result in stock-outs, poor commodity quantification and resource allocation. The main reason for inaccurate data was the lack of recording tools (e.g. registers and consultation books) (Fig. B.9.4). 66

Reporting completeness to perform basic analysis and interpretation was greater than was self-perceived at both health facility (70% versus 56%) and district levels (89% versus 63%), there was a lack of regular production of analytical reports and bulletins, and the analysis carried out was limited, particularly at the 100 Very good health facility level.

One of WHO’s major roles is to bring emerging challenges to the attention of the global community and to coordinate responses to address these challenges. This section of the report documents these challenges and proposed responses. 10.1 PF-HRP2/3 GENE DELETIONS HRP2 is the predominant target of the 412 million WHO has published guidance on investigating P. falciparum-detecting malaria RDTs sold annually. suspected pfhrp2/3 deletions (40), and recommends Parasites that no longer express HRP2 may not be that countries that have reports of pfhrp2/3 deletions detectable by HRP2-based RDTs, and those that no or that border countries with reports should conduct longer express HRP2 and HRP3 are completely invisible representative baseline surveys among suspected to these RDTs.

9102 TROPER AIRALAM DLROW 11 Conclusion WHO’s World malaria report 2019 summarizes global progress in the fight against malaria up to the end of 2018. This is the fourth world malaria report since the launch of the GTS (1). From a baseline of 2015, the GTS aims to achieve, by 2020, a reduction of 40% of malaria morbidity incidence and mortality rate, elimination in at least 10 countries and prevention of reintroduction in all countries that achieved elimination (1). To this end, the analysis shows that in 2018 there were an estimated 228 million cases and 405 000 deaths globally, concentrated mainly in Africa and India. This represents about 3 million fewer cases and 11 000 fewer deaths compared with 2017. On the one hand, the analysis shows that if malaria milestone of our global malaria strategy. In 2015, all of case incidence and mortality rate remained the same these countries were malaria endemic; now they have as those in 2000, globally there would be 320 million either achieved zero malaria cases or are nearing the cases and nearly 1 million malaria deaths in 2018. finish line. Across the six countries of the GMS Instead, there were an estimated 228 million malaria – Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province), Lao People’s cases and 405 000 malaria deaths in 2018. These Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and represent about 30% fewer cases and 60% fewer Viet Nam – there was a 76% reduction in malaria cases deaths in 2018 than would have been the case had and a 95% reduction in deaths in the period levels of malaria incidence and malaria death 2010–2018.

Analyses were limited to each household was available, it was possible to directly populations categorized by NMPs as being at risk. calculate two additional indicators: the proportion of Estimating national net crops through time households with at least one ITN for every two people, and As described by Flaxman et al. (25), national ITN systems the proportion of the population with access to an ITN were represented using a discrete-time stock-and-flow within their household. For the final ITN indicator – the model. Nets delivered to a country by manufacturers were proportion of the population who slept under an ITN the modelled as first entering a “country stock” compartment previous night – the relationship between ITN use and (i.e. stored in-country but not yet distributed to access was defined using 62 surveys in which both these households).
